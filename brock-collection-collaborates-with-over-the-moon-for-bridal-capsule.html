Last week, Laura Vassar and Kristopher Brock announced their first collection for weddings in collaboration with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://overthemoon.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Over The Moon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Over The Moon</a>, an e-tailer of all things feminine and chic for the bride-to-be.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Known for its dainty floral prints, formal fabrications, and ultra-ladylike sensibility, Brock Collection has always been a natural fit for weddings, but the designers felt that it was time for something a bit more official on the bridal front. "I think we all earned a little celebration after this past year. This collection is super special, super custom, and very Brock. [It] checks all the boxes of what a bride is looking for—polished and romantic, without being too delicate," Vassar says.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Every Look from Brock Collection's Debut Bridal Collection</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="brock collection bridal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20210928-overthemoon-lookbook-shot-01-179-1635834910.jpg title="brock collection bridal" width=4388 height=6582 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://overthemoon.com/collections/brock-collection data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The 15-piece capsule collection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The 15-piece capsule collection</a> focuses on looks for the entire trousseau and bridal party, rather than simply the ceremony gown. This isn't how ready-to-wear designers usually enter the bridal space; it's more typical to begin with wedding gowns before turning to bridesmaid dresses or clothing for other events. But for Brock and Vassar, it felt right to launch all their ideas at once. "It was important for us to offer a mix of bridal and bridesmaids silhouettes to speak to the whole bridal party," Brock explains. "[We] feel that we are able to help tell a more cohesive story this way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That story works seamlessly for Over The Moon, whose ultra-femme aesthetic parallels Brock Collection's. "The OTM follower and client typically has an affinity for pieces that are feminine and floral," Alexandra Macon, founder of Over The Moon, says. "She's also craving newness right now. We tried to bring all of those elements into one collection."<br></p><img alt="brock collection davi bridal dress" title="brock collection davi bridal dress" width=2922 height=3650 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/32740-kbr-bcxotm-017-10-1635802683.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristopher Brock</span><p>The Davi dress</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Given that a Brock Collection look is more of an investment than a stereotypical bridesmaid's dress, Brock, Vassar, and Macon treated versatility and longevity as paramount—especially since it's become commonplace for weddings to morph due to health and safety concerns and COVID-19 restrictions. All parties wanted to create pieces that could work even if the event changed. All parties wanted brides to be able to wear their Brock Collection x OTM piece no matter the formality or time of year of their eventual gathering.<br></p><img alt="brock collection bridal" title="brock collection bridal" width=6063 height=4603 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scan-copy-1635802868.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristopher Brock</span><p>The Olya dress</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We all have one dress (or two if you're lucky!) that just works," Vassar says. "It fits right and you feel great wearing it, whether to a cocktail party or a backyard dinner party, it never requires too much thought because it's that good—and that's what these dresses are to me. I want them to become part of your wardrobe staples. One of my favorite dresses is the Davi, which I can see a bride wearing to her shower, and then just as easily styling with a wicker belt and a cardigan for a lunch with girlfriends. I love that this collection can be worn by a bride, a bridesmaid, or a guest, and then still work for their next event if their role in the day should change."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Macon explains that the collection is intended to tick all the possible boxes of a bride's wardrobe. "It was important we provide a variety of styles that a bride can wear to all of the events surrounding her wedding," she says. "For instance, the Devon silhouette could easily be for a backyard ceremony or for a bride to wear to her luncheon the day after the wedding, [but] it is also the perfect city hall dress."</p><img alt="the devon dress brock collection" title="the devon dress brock collection" width=2922 height=3650 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/32740-kbr-bcxotm-018-05-1635802782.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristopher Brock</span><p>The Devon dress</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To achieve that versatility, Vassar and Brock revisited their archive and best sellers, hoping to land on a universally beloved range for weddings based on the label's track record with cocktail, evening gowns, and daytime dresses. "It was such a joy to create," Vassar says. "These are my favorite styles I have ever done in my career, and they seem to be the customer's as well."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Brock explains, the collection was designed for longevity. "For us, it's always been about timeless silhouettes, in effortless yet interesting materials and prints. For this capsule, we developed multiple archival prints in different silks and focused on the most-loved silhouettes from previous seasons."</p><img alt="brock collection bridal" title="brock collection bridal" width=2671 height=4025 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/32740-kbr-bcxotm-007-25-1635802911.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristopher Brock</span><p>The Emilie top and Alexandra skirt</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both brands felt an added pressure to live up to the expectation of the post-pandemic bride, one who has been waiting patiently for the return of celebrations. "I'd be lying if I didn't feel a bit of pressure that it had to be perfect­—but a good kind of pressure, the kind that comes from excitement," Vassar says. "I love to create, knowing there is (and was!) so much pent-up excitement for weddings and events—I felt like we had to nail it. Thinking and imagining all the beautiful celebrations yet to come, specifically after the state we have been in, was truly a dream."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If these collaborators are right, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/wedding/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the future of wedding fashion" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the future of wedding fashion</a> is feminine, floral, gamine, dainty, and sweet—a.k.a. undeniably Brock Collection. Primed for outdoor parties in the spring and summer, the collection features a hit parade of styles, from puff sleeves and off-shoulder necklines to micro florals, Victoriana, prairie chic, and more.</p><img alt="brock collection bridal" title="brock collection bridal" width=982 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2021-11-01-at-5-43-22-pm-1635803011.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristopher Brock</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We're seeing that a lot of our customers and clients really want there to be a wow factor when it comes to their wedding wardrobes," Macon says. "We set out to provide that in a way that feels effortless and fun, but also romantic, special, and, above all else, optimistic for what's [ahead]. After a long, difficult 18 months or so, now felt like the right time to launch a collaboration like this. Weddings are starting to really come back again, and this makes us incredibly happy and hopeful for the future."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brock Collection's 15-piece debut bridal collection, ranging in sizes 0 to 16, is available exclusively at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://overthemoon.com/collections/brock-collection data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Over The Moon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Over The Moon</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/916d9b02-8867-4c91-934d-6abbc239c04d_1547134719.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" title="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.
