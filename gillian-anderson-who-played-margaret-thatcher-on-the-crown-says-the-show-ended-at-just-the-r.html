As she prepares to premiere another royal-centered project, Anderson reflected to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/gillian-anderson-shares-why-she-feels-the-crown-ended-at-the-right-time-exclusive-222506 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Entertainment Tonight</u></a> about the royal madness as of late and why she feels The Crown ended at the right time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iEhKQWTf4RspuWteAwRm7g-1920-80.jpg><p>“I think it probably ended at the right spot,” Anderson said. “It was getting too close to present day. It’s much easier when it was further in the past, and I think people didn’t have necessarily a direct relationship with the people on the screen.”</p><p>The Crown ended its run last December after six seasons, stopping its timeline in 2005. With the introduction of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-catherine/>Kate Middleton</a> at the end of season six—as well as delving deeper into the stories of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-william/>Prince William</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a>—Anderson said that the storyline was catching up to present-day royals, and even if there was truth to how they were being portrayed in the series, “the more outraged seemed to spring up,” she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWxifcQRqn9h6GenfSacpg-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UbAsVTt6mRWaaY65K5Rqgj-1920-80.jpg><p>She added “It’s a moment where we understand they have asked for a bit of peace and quiet around what they’re experiencing and it feels like that’s the least we can do,” Anderson said. “It’s a complicated relationship that the royal family has with the press…I think in this instance with this latest double-whammy of news [about <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/king-charles/>King Charles</a> and the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess of Wales</a>] the least that people can do is give them a bit of a break and let the headlines settle down for them, to process this as the human beings that they actually are.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vsosZYmQPbzayKV6aSVaf-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RuQkom97Ln7wq6MFMmMpBi-1920-80.jpg><p>Scoop, it’s worth noting, is less about Andrew and more about the women—Maitlis, editor Esme Wren (played by Romola Garai) and producer Sam McAlister (portrayed by Billie Piper)—who landed the coveted interview.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
