As the man behind the drum kit for the legendary rock band Toto, Porcaro hit the skins on their biggest hits, including their debut single "Hold the Line," and their Billboard No. 1 smash "Africa," the latter of which was covered by <a href=#>Weezer and Weird Al Yankovich</a> in 2018. According to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, Porcaro was also credited as a co-writer on much of Toto's output, meaning a steady income of royalties from the band's singles and albums, which continued after his tragic death in 1992 at the age of 38.</p><p dir=ltr>As Billboard notes, Porcaro had a long and distinguished career as a session musician, working with such feted acts as Steely Dan and Boz Skaggs before joining Toto. He continued to be a much-in-demand session musician throughout his life, working with some of the biggest names in the business, including Miles Davis, Elton John, Barbara Streisand, and Bruce Springsteen. His credits also include two of Michael Jackson's biggest-selling albums: "Bad" and "Dangerous."</p><p dir=ltr>In November 2021, Primary Wave Music acquired the publishing rigts to Porcaro's catalogue, to the tune of $30 million. "Jeff Porcaro belongs on the Mount Rushmore of great American drummers," said <a href=#>Primary Wave</a>'s Chief Marketing Officer Adam Lowenberg, in an official statement.&nbsp;"We are honored to work with Jeff's wife, Susan, and their sons, to ensure that his legacy is recognized by generations to come."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGxpcnFoZLWww4ytn56rlWKxpq3DZpqepJWXwG65wJ2cZqyVo8Buu8VmpKKknJ68r7%2BMoqVmamBnf3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
