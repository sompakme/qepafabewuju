Coming from Australia and growing up around all the anti-cancer campaigns, it's been drilled into me; I walk on the shady side of the street. I've recently found a fantastic cream – it's by Spirig and called 'Day Long'. You can use the tiniest amount and you don't need to reapply, so I wear it every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: Which are the creams and serums in your <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/search-results/?q=skincare" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=skincare class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skincare</a> regime?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: My skin is really unbalanced so I'm choosy about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/reviews/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=products class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">products</a>.

My skin can get so dry and when I put that on it immediately takes that away, especially for my lips and around my eyes too.

People started commenting, even when I felt like crap, and it wasn't just hydrating my skin it changed its luminosity. My husband even noticed. I could dye my hair blue and he wouldn't notice, so when he said something I knew it was working!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: Do you have any tricks when it comes to applying creams and make-up?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: I've learnt that massage is really big when applying. I used to just put it on but you actually need to massage it in so it works with your skin and isn't like a masked layer. That why it's really important to know what you're putting into your skin. The SK-II foundation actually has pitera in it [a nutrient rich liquid] so it's not like you're massaging anything horrible into it. My regime is super simple; it's just five minutes in the morning and five at night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: So what's the secret to the glow when wearing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/ten-of-the-best/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="make up" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">make up</a>?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: I put the SK-II essence on top of my finishing power. It sets the make up and removes that flat <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/secrets/8-great-face-powders-80543#slide-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=powdery class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">powdery</a> look. That's a really good trick. Also, just don't wear a lot of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/reviews/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=make-up class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">make-up</a>…</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: What about family beauty remedies, have you had any secrets passed down through the Blanchett generations?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: My mum was huge on sunscreen and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/ten-of-the-best/10-favourite-facial-moisturisers-130179?click=main_sr" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=moisturiser class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">moisturiser</a>, especially Oil of Olay, and also looking after yourself beyond just your face. You have to pay just as much attention to your neck too. The biggest thing I took from her though is putting spoons in the freezer for your eyes. If you haven't done that, you've got to try it! I flew into <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/going-out/who-what-where/giles-deacon-best-london-destinations-fashion-culture-shopping-240812?click=main_sr" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=London class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">London</a> and I was up with the children at 2am, so I got the hotel staff to put teaspoons in their freezer. I put them on before The Hobbit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/going-out/celebrities/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=premiere class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">premiere</a>, it's so brutal you totally wake up!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: And how about diet and exercise?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: The last two years I have really tried to keep in shape but I must admit when my children have a concert at school or I have to squeeze in another board meeting, those are the first things to go out of the window. I was on stage a lot this year, which naturally kept me fit and I also drink lemon juice and hot water in the morning. There's no grand diet plan but I try to stay away from wheat, even though I love bread as much as the next person, and I avoid additives. Then again, you also need to live your life and there'll be evenings when I drink give glasses of champagne...!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: If you ever need to get in shape quickly for a part or a shoot what do you do?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: I've done a lymphatic cleanse a few times for liver, kidneys and gallbladder – there's a guy in Los Angles called Dr. Bo Wagner. It's not to lose weight, it's more of a detox but I felt fabulous after it. It's hardcore; it's a month long and all herbal and you detox, cleanse and then renew everything. You don't eat for a week but it really made me feel incredible.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: Do you have any treatments you like to book in regularly?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: I'm not a fan of facials, I don't like people prodding and poking at my skin. I do love a deep tissue massage though, and acupuncture. If I have free time that's what I book and it needs to be a real pummel. Jill Damon is fantastic in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/going-out/who-what-where/london-mayor-boris-johnson-on-best-london-destinations-olympic-plans-and-life-before-politics-240712?click=main_sr" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=London class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">London</a>, but a Korean bathhouse anywhere always seem to be great too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: What about hair care?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: Nicola Clarke does my hair, from John Frieda. When you've got a great colour, you can get away with a lot. I'm always grateful when someone styles my hair, otherwise it'll be pulled back or under a hat. Moroccan Oil does a fantastic shampoo and conditioner too, which I stick with day to day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Bazaar</strong>: Finally, what's the trick for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/going-out/celebrities/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red carpet" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">red carpet</a> beauty?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>Blanchett</strong>: If you're going to the Oscars, by the time you've waited in that traffic jam and actually got out of the car it's been ages and your make-up can slip. I always wear waterproof mascara so it doesn't run and I try to avoid fiddling with my face. I'll take the lipstick with me to reapply: the Tom Ford range is the best. They're really mosturising and he makes these perfect natural pink shades. I hear he's coming out with a hybrid lipstick, lipgloss and lip balm which I really want to use next.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch Cate discussing her work with SK-II below</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty-health/secrets/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="READ OTHER BEAUTY SECRETS FROM BAZAAR'S BEAUTY ICONS" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">READ OTHER BEAUTY SECRETS FROM BAZAAR'S BEAUTY ICONS</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">//</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ56axLR7wG9wcHBfmK61sYybo5qmk52ytcCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
