But Bridezilla or not, they have to be flawless. To help you make the most of your investment—for the Big Day and beyond—we asked <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.lashperfect.co.uk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lash Perfect" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lash Perfect</a> expert Emma Apps for her ultimate aftercare advice.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1.Time it right</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You want your eyelash extensions to look as full and uniform as possible on the day, so wait until very near the time. "I recommend having them done two-three days before the wedding", Emma instructs. "This will also give you the perfect opportunity to lie down with your eyes closed for an hour or two, which can only be a good thing so close to the occasion." You can't argue with that.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2.Never skip the aftercare advice</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For obvious reasons, the basic aftercare is more important than ever when you're a bride—so don't be slack. As Emma instructs, "Keep the lashes dry for 24 hours after application, avoiding heat and steam" (such as the gym, very hot showers and baths). This will allow the adhesive to cure effectively, and mean the extensions will stay in place as they should. "All oily products should be avoided directly on the lashes for the duration you are wearing them, as this too can weaken the bond," she adds.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3.Use the right cleansers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to removing make-up, use professional oil free products. "Lash Perfect Lift Off oil free eye make-up remover and a specially designed cleansing cloth will effectively and safely remove any traces of make-up, without damaging the extensions," Emma says. Soak the cloth in warm water and apply the cleanser so it foams, then hold it over the eye area for 20 seconds to lift away make-up. "Face wipes and cotton wool should be avoided as the fibers can snag and tangle in your lashes."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4.Avoid sleeping on your front</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Try to avoid sleeping directly on the lashes," Emma says, but if you do, gently run a clean mascara brush through the top of them. "If you have classic individual extensions on, Lash Perfect Finishing Glaze will help to readjust the lash direction and hold them in place," she says. Consider it a hairspray for your lashes.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5.Don't be tempted to pick</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It sounds obvious but don't let yourself pick at the extensions. As Emma puts it, "you want them looking nice and neat without unnecessary gaps". In an ideal world you should have them regularly maintained. "A 30-minute appointment every fortnight is an ideal way to keep your extensions looking even and full, as well as keeping your natural lashes healthy," she says.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">6.Beware the honeymoon hazards</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lash extensions will cut your getting ready routine in half on honeymoon, but don't forget to care for them. "Be careful of sun cream," Emma says, "as it tends to be very oily". Swimming? "I recommend rinsing them with some fresh water after being in the sea or pool if possible."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6KurLGMrqdmppGeubR7zZ6urGeRaX52fpBorp6clJ67qHnEspylmaOdeqbE056lrKGfo8BuwMipqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
