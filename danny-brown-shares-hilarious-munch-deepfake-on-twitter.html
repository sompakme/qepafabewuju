While many have made dystopian predictions and others have embraced it as its own art form, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Danny Brown</a> is somewhere in the middle. Seemingly as a joke, he shared a deepfake video to Twitter that caught a LOT of attention from fans. In the clip Brown's face is superimposed over <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> for part of the music video for her song "Munch (Feelin' U)." But it doesn't just stop there, the clip also features his voice rapping the song.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Viewers were surprised and confused by the clip but pretty much everyone agreed it was hilarious. Many responded with gifs and reaction videos either their shocked surprise or general indifference to the clip. Many compared it to the music video <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> released for "The Heart Part V" last year. In that video, Kendrick deepfakes himself into the image of many controversial black celebrities like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>, OJ Simpson, and Will Smith. In the final verse he famously transforms into <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nipsey Hussle</a> and forgives the rapper's murderer. "This isn’t the influence Kendrick was thinking he’d have after dropping heart pt 5," one commenter replied to Brown's clip.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-danny-brown-deepfaked-into-an-ice-spice-song>Danny Brown Deepfaked Into An Ice Spice Song</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year, Danny Brown teamed up with another beloved underground rapper, JPEGMAFIA. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Together the pair released Scaring The Hoes</a> a critically acclaimed collaborative project that also featured redveil. They followed it up a few months later with a DLC Pack sharing four new collaborative songs. One of the tracks notably contained <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">some disses aimed at Baby Keem</a> for the family ties that helped him achieve his current status.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Danny Brown's last solo album was released all the way back in 2019. He's often spoken publicly about the battle he's having with his label to get a follow-up project released. Earlier this year he claimed he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">turned in a new album two years ago</a> that still hasn't been released.
