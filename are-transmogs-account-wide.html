You can transmogrify a non-artifact weapon with an artifact appearance unlocked by a different character on the account.<h2>Are Transmogs account wide Shadowlands?</h2>Yes. But you must get to a certain point of covenant ownership before they show. My lv50 toon was able to mog the Harmonious Sigil (Kyrian) backpiece just by doing the Threads of Fate intro and picking Kyrian.<h2>Are wow appearances account wide?</h2>Appearances (also known as Wardrobe) is a transmogrification feature introduced in World of Warcraft: Legion that enables a player to collect and save equipment appearances (including weapon enchants) account-wide.<h2>Are Covenant Transmogs account wide?</h2>Yes but only if: That character is in the covenant you want transmog in. You hit reown 80 in that covenant then its account-wide.<h2>Account-Wide Progress, NO Borrowed Power, Reputations & MORE!</h2><p></p><h2>Is covenant swapping account wide?</h2>Regardless of your current Covenant affiliation, you can use cosmetic rewards that you earned on a Covenant you reached Renown 80 with. This benefit is account-wide.<h2>Can you use covenant Transmog on alts?</h2>Both the Covenant switching and the use of cosmetic rewards will also apply to alts once the Renown threshold is reached on one character.<h2>Can you get Transmogs for other classes?</h2>Players can mix and match Legion artifact appearances of different class specializations to their weapons! With these new rules, you are able to transmog any artifact appearance from your class, as long as it follows normal weapon transmog rules (i.e. 1-hand to 1-hand, 2-hand to 2-hand, etc).<h2>Is Thunderfury Transmog account wide?</h2>So if I farm Thunderfury with my mage, can I transmog it with my rogue? Legendary items are account wide, yes. If you can equip it on the original char you farmed it on, it is account wide.<h2>Are Soulshapes account wide?</h2>Soulshapes and Crittershapes are NOT account-wide.<p>You will need to farm separate Soulshapes or Crittershapes for each Night Fae character you have.</p><h2>Can you get all Covenant Transmogs?</h2>You can transmog whatever you want that you've unlocked from any covenant so long as you have a toon in that covenant that unlocked 80 renown.<h2>When did mounts become account Wide World of Warcraft?</h2>Patch 5.0. 4 is live and most of your achievements, pets and mounts are now account-wide.<h2>Can I Transmog leather to cloth?</h2>You transmog what you use. Plate users only get plate, even though they can wear mail, leather and cloth. If it wasn't like this, then cloth users would all have been at a significant disadvantage in transmog farming. Because they can't wear anything other than cloth.<h2>Can you reroll stats on gear in wow?</h2>Introduced to Azeroth by the Highborne, Reforging (also called thaumaturgy) allowed undesired stats on gear to be exchanged for more useful stats. It allowed 40% of a single secondary stat (such as critical strike, dodge, haste, hit or parry rating) or spirit to be exchanged for another secondary stat or spirit.<h2>What does Transmog mean?</h2>transitive verb. : to change or alter greatly and often with grotesque or humorous effect. intransitive verb. : to become transmogrified.<h2>How do I get another covenant Transmog?</h2><p>These can be unlocked as follows:</p><li>The covenant armor set must be the preferred armor type for the character that obtained it.</li><li>Renown 80 for that covenant must be reached by the same character who obtained the armor set.</li><li>This must be repeated for each armor type that you want to unlock.</li><h2>Can you Transmog Shadowghast armor?</h2>You will not be able to transmog any Shadowlands legendaries at launch, but there are plans to allow transmog of the full set in...<h2>Can you Transmog legendary armor Shadowlands?</h2>The Shadowlands legendary sets are currently not available for transmog. They may be available to transmog later in the expansion.<h2>Is Transmog free in WoW?</h2>So come on, Blizzard. Let's make transmog free, so the joy of playing dress-up with our WoW characters all the time is accessible (and easy) for everyone.<h2>Can rogues Transmog Warglaives?</h2>Who Can Transmog This: Rogues, Death Knights, Warriors, Monks, and Demon Hunters can transmog these legendaries. Who Can Obtain It: These warglaives can be obtained by Rogues, Death Knights, Warriors, Monks, and Demon Hunters.<h2>Can Taeshalach be bonus rolled?</h2>TL;DR: Taeshalach *most likely* can be bonus rolled, *most likely* cannot be traded, can be obtained on multiple difficulties a week, and taking more looting-capable players does not decrease your chance of personally rolling and getting it.<h2>Do I lose Covenant gear if I switch?</h2>When you leave a covenant, you lose all Covenant specific benefits of the Covenant you are leaving. Anything you have unlocked on the previous Covenant will not convert to the new one. This includes Renown, covenant abilities, appearances, soulbinds, mounts, titles, and sanctum upgrades.<h2>Do you lose all your anima when you switch covenants?</h2>When you switch, all of your Anima stays with your original Covenant, but when you use the Broker Mark of Distinction, you'll receive a thousand Anima to get you started with your new Covenant, as well as your Covenant mount.<h2>Can't Transmog after changing covenants?</h2>As discussed in this thread, weapons that have a covenant-specific appearance can no longer be transmogged after switching covenants. For example, I recently obtained a PvP weapon while I was Kyrian. The weapon has the typical Kyrian look/feel to it.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8CrnGasopa7tLnOoKpmmZOYvLa602auopyV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
