My makeup bag is full of committed relationships.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.</strong></p><p>My makeup bag is full of committed relationships. There is the MAC eyeliner I’ve worn since I was a teenager, my favorite $5 Maybelline mascara, the <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>MERIT Beauty blush</a> that blends perfectly into my skin, and an <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Hourglass palette</a> that gives me a gorgeous glow. But, try as I may, I’m very non-committal when it comes to foundation.</p><p>It’s not that there aren’t any number of amazing foundations out there. In truth, I’ve tried many that I have liked and grown accustomed to, but inevitably, there comes a time when the novelty wears off and I start to notice that my skin looks blotchy, tired, shiny, oily, and greasy. Plus, as I’ve grown older, I’ve become more aware of the importance of daily sunscreen use, which is why I typically prefer foundations, tinted creams, and tinted serums that include a broad-spectrum SPF.</p><p>So when I heard about Tula’s newly released <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin Brightening Serum Skin Tint SPF 30</a>, I knew I had to try it—especially since I’m a diehard fan of their<a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Protect + Glow Daily Sunscreen Gel</a> and their <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Brightening Treatment Drops Triple Vitamin C Serum</a>. With a company that is committed to SPF-centric and probiotic-infused products, it was only a matter of time before Tula made a leap into makeup territory and dropped an amazing tinted serum that doubles as a daily foundation.</p><p>What I appreciate about Tula’s approach to makeup products is that the focus still remains on skincare. Instead of masking your face with hard-to-pronounce, pore-clogging ingredients, you’d never recognize that do nothing for your skin’s health, Tula remains committed to making sure your skin is protected and nourished with ingredients like collagen, which helps with fine lines and wrinkles; rainbow seabright elixir, which brightens, protects from the effects of pollution and blue light, and evens out your skin’s tone; and hyaluronic acid and ceramides, which hydrate and plump your skin.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1157,w_2056,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,h_251/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1663103130/tula_radiant_skin_serum_skin_tint_copy_rzaego style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=ConversionCard__title>Tula Radiant Skin Brightening Tint With SPF 30</p><p>The <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Radiant Skin tinted serum</a> comes in a wide variety of shades—30 to be exact—so you won’t have any problem tracking down the right hue for you, especially with the company’s nifty shade finder. The quick quiz asks you a few questions about your complexion to match you with the right shade. My results turned out to be a perfect match, and I was impressed with just how well the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Radiant Skin Brightening Serum Skin Tint</a> blended right into my fair skin. In fact, I’ve never had a foundation that has matched my skin so well.</p><p>Before applying the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin</a> tinted serum, I applied Tula’s mega-popular <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Filter Primer</a> first. While you definitely don’t have to use a primer to get wonderful results with the serum, the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Filter Primer</a>, which comes in four shades, will help even out your complexion and make the skin tint serum last even longer throughout the day. It also gives you a dew-like finish that no highlighter could recreate.</p><p><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin’</a>s non-comedogenic, lightweight formula is equal parts creamy and dewy and is okay to apply with your fingers, but I would suggest using a blending brush or sponge to apply and even everything out. You don’t have to apply very much to finish your look either; I used about three to four squeezes total and was able to apply the serum across my whole face. I used a loose finishing powder to settle and complete my look, but honestly, you could do without it if you just want to stick with the serum.</p><p>Something I noted: the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin Brightening Serum Skin Tint</a> isn’t a light coverage foundation, but it’s also not heavy where it looks like you’re caked in layers of makeup. The product gives you a medium coverage that still looks very natural, with a certain ethereal glow you’ll appreciate. As someone who tends to have dry, patchy skin, I noticed the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin </a>serum also moisturized my skin very well – an added bonus.</p><p>I’m not the only one who has fallen in love with Tula’s <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin </a>serum either. The 4.5-star rated product has tons of users attesting to its lightweight and breathable feel, its beautiful glow, and great makeup coverage. At $40 the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=sponsored>Radiant Skin Brightening Serum Skin Tint</a> might seem a bit pricey, especially if you’re using it as a daily foundation, but with the added benefit of SPF 30, you can combine two must-have products into one flawless foundation. It’s definitely worth the investment.</p><p><strong>MORE FROM SCOUTED:</strong></p><p>Don’t forget to <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>check out our coupon site</a> to find more beauty deals, including <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Sephora coupons</a>, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Ulta coupons</a>, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Nordstrom coupons</a>, and <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Macy’s coupons</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqcKtrYyrmJ2hkaPBbr%2FKoqVmq5ueu27AyKerZquVp8KuedGeraKdpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
