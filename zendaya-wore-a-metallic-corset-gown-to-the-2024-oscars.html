The actress arrived on the red carpet with only minutes to spare before the ceremony began, but trust us, her late arrival was worth waiting for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In true Zendaya fashion, she had us in a chokehold with her gorgeous Armani Privé gown. From its twisted one-shouldered silhouette to a built-in sparkly black corset that complemented the fabric's embroidered palm-tree print in a shade the house is calling "antique rose," Zendaya's dress was simply a masterclass in craftsmanship. Accessory-wise, she opted for a pair of pink diamond drop earrings that peeked out from beneath her curled bob. Finishing off her glam, Zendaya added a nude-pink lip and rose-colored blush to her cheekbones.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star is presenting at the prestigious ceremony, and although she does not have any projects nominated tonight, Zendaya's new movie Dune: Part Two could potentially be on the ballot next year. Denis Villeneuve's second installation of the space epic (based on the 1965 novel) has been met with rave reviews. Not only that, but the famous cast's many appearances have generated plenty of buzz surrounding the movie, which hit theaters on Mar. 1.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zendaya's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on-theme press wardrobe</a> (dreamt up with her longtime stylist, Law Roach) has been at the center of much of the coverage. From her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Mugler robot suit</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>cyborg skirt set</a> to her most recent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>futuristic white cut-out gown</a> (with gold scale-like embellishments), every look brought her Dune character Chani to the red carpet.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If Dune: Part Two takes over next year's awards circuit (much like the first iteration did), we could see Margot Robbie passing the sartorial baton of character dressing to Zendaya and Roach after Robbie's array of Barbie-approved awards season looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, the first film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and took home six awards for Best Original Score, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572Z6lnZmplnqwv8KaqaxlYmV%2FdXnGqK6nZZGnuqK6yGanq6Gmmnp5go9sbXBp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
