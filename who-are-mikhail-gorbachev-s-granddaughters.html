I remember the constant hush at home. We were all buried in our books," she said, via <a href=#>Russia Beyond</a>.</p><p>Gorbachev also deeply loved his wife, Raisa, according to <a href=#>Hindustan Times</a>. And although lots of men love their wives, in Gorbachev's case he was smitten from the moment he met her. He wrote in his memoir "Alone with Myself,"&nbsp;(via Hindustan Times) that after meeting his future bride, "I felt I was losing my head. I wanted to see Raisa and be wherever she was."&nbsp;Raisa died in 1999 from cancer at 67, per <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. Of her death, Gorbechev wrote, "I had never felt so lonely in my life ... I hope that we will meet again... We were happy together." While Raisa was gone, Gorbechev still had his daughter and granddaughters, who grew up to become very familiar with the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEj3FoampfrLWwecCrnGalmaC1orXLZp6oqpKWsKmx1axkoKqRo7GlrdSgn62doqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
