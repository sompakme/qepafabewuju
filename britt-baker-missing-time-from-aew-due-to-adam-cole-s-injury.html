Adam Cole’s injury threw a big wrench in those plans, and now it appears that it will also cause Britt Baker to miss some time with AEW.</p><p>Adam Cole sustained an ankle injury two weeks ago on AEW Dynamite: Grand Slam special while on his way to the ring during the World Title match between MJF and Samoa Joe. He leaped off the entrance ramp to the floor at ringside and subsequently started limping. Following the event, Cole headed to the hospital, and he was later spotted on crutches.</p><p>Adam Cole and MJF were scheduled to defend the ROH Tag Team Titles at AEW WrestleDream this Sunday, but Cole disclosed on Dynamite this week that he requires surgery. Consequently, MJF will go solo and defend the titles in a handicap match against The Righteous.</p><p>During a Q&A session behind Fightful’s paywall, Sean Sapp stated that Adam Cole’s girlfriend, Britt Baker, will also be absent from AEW television for a few weeks as she assists Cole in his post-surgery recovery.</p><p>“I have been told that Britt will likely not be at TV for a couple of weeks because she’s going to be taking care of Adam Cole, that she had to drive him around, that he was not able to take care of himself.”</p><p>We’re hoping that Adam Cole is able to recover. This hiatus was not the plan, especially after he had to miss so much time due to a concussion. Hopefully, he can heal up fast and get back to action.</p><p>Adam Cole isn’t expected to make any live AEW events during his recovery. This leaves MJF’s storyline with him frozen, but only time will tell if the company is able to wrap things up in some fashion.</p><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
