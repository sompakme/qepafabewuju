Ruled by the FBI&nbsp;not&nbsp;to be a suicide note, it ostensibly reads as random phrases—or a code—that may have been a "red herring," according to Rivera's brother, or may have deeper meaning behind what happened to him. It includes references to the Freemasons, among other things.</p><h2 id=what-does-rey-rivera-apos-s-letter-say-3>What does Rey Rivera's letter say?</h2><p>His wife Allison says she knows he wrote the note the day he disappeared, because there were "scraps in the trash can." The font was shrunk down and the entire note was contained on a single sheet of paper that was about seven inches long, folded, and taped in a hard-to-reach area.&nbsp;</p><p>The note begins, "Brothers and Sisters, Right now, around the world volcanoes are erupting. What an awesome sight. Whom virtue unites death will not separate," the last of which is apparently a Masonic phrase (the letter apparently closes with a Masonic phrase, too).</p><p>Not covered in the episode but discussed in&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.wbaltv.com/article/suicide-or-murder-evidence-reviewed/7054411# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>local news coverage</a>: Rivera had expressed an interest in joining his local chapter of the Freemasons shortly before his death and even bought&nbsp;Freemasons for Dummies. His wife said he had an interest in secret societies, and was also interested in being a screenwriter for movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UsXdvKzYz8UiVorzLNZFo-1920-80.png><p>Other excerpts of the note, from&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.newsweek.com/unsolved-mysteries-netflix-rey-rivera-note-freemasons-1514973 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Newsweek</a>:</p>"I'd like to welcome those who accepted out invitations for membership during the game.

He referenced film directors Stanley Kubrick and M. Night Shyamalan as well as star Christopher Reeve.</p><p>He also says, "That was a well-played game. Congratulations to all who participated. But, it was time to wake up. So, here I am."—what game is he referring to? "I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them, as secrets," he writes. And: "Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit. Take care, and enjoy the festivities."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YZCet8nEwpAX4qzr5Tk7SF-1920-80.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVhoWkiK7LDp23aeGd2Q7M-1920-80.png><h2 id=what-does-the-note-mean-3>What does the note mean?</h2><p>As of this moment, no one really knows. The full note doesn't look to be available online, and even his closest family members have been left scratching their heads as to what it represents. The episode suggests that it could be some kind of code—but if that's true, no one has been able to crack it thus far.</p><p>Since the episode aired, however, there have been a couple of interesting theories from viewers.

It had all these names of actors, his friends and family, quotes from free masons and a list of movies.One of these movies was The Game. Immediately, I thought: OF COURSE! There is one big scene at the end of the movie where the main character jumped off the roof (!) of a fancy hotel and goes through the (glass) roof. The similarities to Rey are truly astonishing.The whole movie is about this crazy game...that makes you think you lose everything in order to let you appreciate life again. Rey was an unsuccessful movie script writer and maybe he got involved in [something] that tried to imitate The Game in some way.<p>If you have information about Rivera's disappearance, visit unsolved.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxrYGyBeoGWaKmesV2ntrex0Zpkp6ekmnq2utKoo6%2BdlGK6ur%2FTnqminaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
