Both he and Beyoncé famously made a lifestyle change at the end of 2013 when they decided to go vegan for 22 days, and both enjoyed the benefits of their diet. Jay-Z announced that he would be going vegan on his website at the time. He wrote: "On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!!" Beyoncé reportedly went on a vegan diet again in the follow up to her Coachella performance in April, following the arrival of her twins Rumi and Sir Carter in June 2017.</p><p id=eCgvMzwEMgeD><a class=hm-link href=#>RELATED: Gordon Ramsay reveals incredible secret behind his 50Ib weight loss</a></p><p id=e8XvyQyfkPPL data-wc=59>During the opening night of their tour, Beyoncé and Jay-Z treated fans to several personal videos showing a rare glimpse into their family life, including one where they appeared to be renewing their wedding vows with their three children.
