An archaeologist named Lillian Sloane (Barbara Hershey) joins the team as they pursue clues across the mountains in order to uncover a band of Cheyenne Indians who have been hidden for more than 100 years. As a result of the deranged Sheriff Deegan’s (Kurtwood Smith) exploitation of the violence as justification for retribution, Gates must struggle to preserve the Cheyenne people from annihilation at the hands of a ruthless band of masked vigilantes.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span></span></p><h3><span>What year did the last of the dogmen appear on the scene?</span></h3><p><span>The date was September 8, 1995.</span></p><p><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>Is Tom Berenger the father of a son?</span></h3><p><span>Patrick Moore is a British actor and director.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><span>Who provided the narration for the film Last of the Dogmen?</span></h3><p><span>Wilford Brimley was an English author and poet who lived in the nineteenth century.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>Is Tom Berenger still working as an actor?</span></h3><p><span>In 1988, he founded the Tom Berenger Acting Scholarship Fund to recognise and reward theatre students who had shown brilliance in their performances.
