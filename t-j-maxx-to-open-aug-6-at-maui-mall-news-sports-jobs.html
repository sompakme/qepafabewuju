Maxx will sell products purchased around the world, an announcement said, but it also will feature Hawaii merchandise, including aloha wear, specialty food items, coffee, jewelry and bath and body products.</p><p>The Maui Mall has seen other improvements and additions, including:</p><p>* Headquarters of Hawaii, which will open Aug. 15. It offers Hawaiian specialty streetwear.</p><p>* Restaurant Max’s of Manila, which will open in the fall. Construction is expected to begin in the coming weeks, the mall announced Monday.</p><p>* The Fun Factory expansion that nearly doubled its square footage. To accommodate the expansion, Haleakala Solar has relocated and will feature a larger showroom.</p><p>“The improvements and additions to the mall will enrich our customers’ overall dining, retail and entertainment experiences and will attract new tenants to Maui Mall . . . and continue to enhance Maui Mall as a community gathering place,” said Bryan McFarland, principal-development of mall owner Alberta Development Partners.</p><p>The Maui Mall was originally developed by Alexander & Baldwin in 1971 and covers 25 acres. In January 2014, A&B sold the mall, which had 185,700 square feet of commercial space at the time before the expansion, to Alberta Development Partners LLC, based in Greenwood Village, Colo.</p><p>In a first quarter supplemental real estate report released by A&B in May, the sale price was listed at $64 million.</p><p>The Maui Mall is home to Whole Foods Market, Longs Drugs and Regal Maui Mall Megaplex 12. The Maui County Service Center at the mall will be moving to its new home in A&B’s Maui Business Park II. The county purchased the site for $7.1 million, which included a lot near Baldwin Park, and is currently working on construction plans.</p><p>The county has a lease with the mall until 2017 for the 17,000 square foot service center that houses the county’s Division of Motor Vehicles and Licensing, Real Property Tax Division and treasury collections offices.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2UaGdwZ6Rit265wLGvZqyfYryxsc1mmK6fXWt6osCMppiuoV2irq24jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
