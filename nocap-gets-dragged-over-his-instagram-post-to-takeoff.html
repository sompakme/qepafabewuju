But everything happens for a reason. Get your rest Thug.”</p><span></span><p>LAS VEGAS, NV - SEPTEMBER 23: Takeoff of Migos performs onstage during the Daytime Village Presented by Capital One at the 2017 HeartRadio Music Festival at the Las Vegas Village on September 23, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

One fan commented, That’s the worse condolence u can give.It’s like ‘sorry it had to u but thank god it wasn’t me’ please.” Another added, “I mean say how you feel but man I’ll be damned a ni**a chalk my death up to “everything happens for a reason.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The 24-year old “Ghetto Angels” rapper deleted the seemingly insensitive post shortly after. Aside from Cap’s message to Takeoff, other friends of the late rapper penned heartfelt notes about the slain star following his passing.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Quality Control CEO&nbsp; Pierre “P” Thomas <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shared a touching message</a> about the Infinity Links rapper with his Instagram followers, “Young King @yrntakeoff I don’t know where to begin but I want to say that anybody that knows me knows how much I love you and anybody that knows you knows that you definitely didn’t deserve to die at such a young age.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He concluded the lengthy message by urging fans to respect Takeoff’s family’s grieving process at this time. “As we mourn your lost I pray that everyone please be understanding to what the family has to see on the internet with the videos and negative comments. This is somebody’s child. Let them get thru this process with peace and love. You came from the stars so I know you will forever be up there watching down on all of us. I will forever love you”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Share your thoughts on NoCap’s post below.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaYN3fZVmpaibkaV6qLHTrGSdqpGctKawjKitnqpdnba0ecinqq2Zl6eurnnPqKqtZaSkerWtyp6mn54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
