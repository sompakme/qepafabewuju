He started his professional boxing career on the right note by beating Jose Ramirez via knockout on October 12, 2013, in Nevada. This was a non-title fight.</li><li>After the win, he dared to challenge for a title while trying to make a world record. His dream of taking the WBO featherweight title was shattered when Orlando Salido defeated him on March 1, 2014, in San Antonio, Texas.</li><li>It did take long before he went back to his winning ways when he beat Gary Russell Jr, winning the WBO featherweight champion on June 22, 2014. The fight was organized after Salido lost the title.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6bfe08719349bcc5.png><ul><li>As the WBO featherweight titleholder, he had to defend it against a mandatory opponent who was Chonlatarn Piriyapinyo, a Thai boxer. The fight was at Cotai Arena, Venetian Resort, in Macao on November 22, 2014. It was a highly competitive fight, and even though he got a win, his left hand was injured.</li><li>The victory in the mandatory challenge gave him the chance to face Gamalier Rodriguez, who, at that time, was enjoying a 17 bout winning streak.

The contest was organized at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Paradise, Nevada, on November 7, 2015. It was easy and deservedly won for Vasyl as he retained his featherweight title.</li><li>It was now time to seek significant challenges, and he had his eyes on the super-featherweight division. The titleholder was Roman ‘Rocky’ Martinez. The fight was organized on June 11, 2016. He outpaced and outclassed Rocky in every aspect of the bout until he knocked him out on the fifth round.

He opted to move to the lightweight division where his first opponent was Jorge Linares, the titleholder at Madison Square, New York City, on May 12, 2018.
