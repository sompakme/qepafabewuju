Swapping her typical mom-off-duty style for something a bit sexier, Garner opted for a strapless little white dress by Gabriela Hearst that featured a body-hugging silhouette and columns of reflective silver embellishments."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Swapping her typical mom-off-duty style for something a bit sexier, Garner opted for a strapless little white dress by Gabriela Hearst that featured a body-hugging silhouette and columns of reflective silver embellishments. She masterfully mixed metals and wore a pair of gold peep-toe sandals that matched her smattering of rings, while finishing off her look with silvery diamond drop earrings.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a pop of color, Jen painted her nails a coral-pink color and swiped on a coordinating shade of lipstick and blush. Her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>freshly-chopped bob </a>was worn down in loose waves that were slicked-back behind her ears.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the premiere, Garner posed on the red carpet with Reese Witherspoon, who serves as an executive producer on the seven-part series. The television adaptation of the mystery-thriller novel written by Laura Dave follows Hannah (played by Garner) and her 16-year-old stepdaughter Bailey (Angourie Rice) while they team up to figure out what happened to their missing husband and father.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jen was so passionate about the role of Hannah that she wrote a letter to production about why she should be cast. “This is the job right. You have to be able to put yourself into the ring," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a>. "It’s a very vulnerable job, you hear no a lot and sometimes you have to put your neck out there and I’m grateful that in this case it paid off."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Witherspoon, meanwhile, was impressed with Garner expressing her interest. “It was so great to hear her passion. She picked up the phone, we had long conversations about it," she said. "It was the perfect part for her. I love that she was going to be this kick ass woman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9us8CrpZ6qXaG2tcDLnmSwoJmpsm6w0Z6qrGWclsC1edOhoKefXZ2ybsDOpZtmpZVivbOxzKKcq51dbIF5fJZqag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
