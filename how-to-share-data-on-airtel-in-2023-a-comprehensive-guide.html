Here is the ultimate guide on how to transfer data on Airtel using the Data Me2U service.</p><h2>How to share data on Airtel using Data Me2U</h2><p class=align-left>Me2U, also known as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Airtel Data Share,</a> is a special service that allows an Airtel subscriber to show love to another Airtel subscriber by transferring a portion of their existing data allowance to another person.</p><p class=align-left>This means you <a href=#>can</a> buy a bundle and share it with your family members, friends or even colleagues as long as they are on the <a href=#>Airtel network.</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7937daacf94acfb6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"You need constant electricity": Man who got machine that gives dollars daily shares more videos</span></p></a><h3>Me2U registration</h3><p class=align-left>If you are a subscriber on the Airtel network, you don't have to register for the Airtel Me2U service, as every active line can enjoy the service. You just need to change the default PIN that came with the line to a personal and more secure PIN that you can remember easily but one that is difficult for anyone to guess.</p><h3>How to access Me2U</h3><p class=align-left>The Airtel transfer code for the Me2U service is *312#. Therefore, to access the service, dial *312#, then select the "Gift" or "Share Data" option. Thereafter, select "Data Me2U". And that is how to share Airtel data.</p><h3>Which data bundle plans are available for Me2U?</h3><p class=align-left>The regular <a href=#>bundle plans</a>, such as the Weekly/Daily Bundles, Monthly Bundles, and MegaPacks, can be shared using the service.</p><h3>What is the validity of the shared data bundle?</h3><p class=align-left>The shared bundles will have the same validity as the original bundles. For example, if you have a bundle whose validity end date is 20th August 2023, and you share some of that data, the recipient's data will also expire on 20th August 2023.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/40adc272bdf4648e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Each is N400k": Smart man opens bicycle business as fuel price rise higher in Nigeria, imports bikes for sale</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7937daacf94acfb6.jpg><h3>How much data can be shared at a time?</h3><p class=align-left>You can share a maximum of 200MB with one person.</p><h3>How many people can I share with?</h3><p class=align-left>You can share with a maximum of two recipients daily. This means you can share a maximum of 200MB each with two recipients daily. You can share bundles with the same person again only after that person finishes the first shared bundle.</p><h3>Do you need to get a special SIM card to use the Me2U service?</h3><p class=align-left>No, you do not. No special SIM card is required for the Me2U service, as all newly activated SIMs are automatically data-enabled. However, each SIM must have been KYC-ed, without which data activity will be automatically disabled. Customers are advised to visit the nearest Airtel retail or partner outlets to perform KYC.</p><h2>How to gift data on Airtel</h2><p class=align-left>Data gifting allows you to buy a bundle plan for another <a href=#>Airtel customer</a> by paying with your own <a href=#>airtime</a>. This is different from the Me2U service, as you actually aren't sharing your bundles with someone else. You are buying them their own.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0e063e5f3433de26.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Elon Musk's Twitter is sharing $5m ads revenue to qualified users in Nigeria, other countries</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Note: </strong>Me2U is possible for only normal bundles, while gifting is possible for all bundle types.</p><p class=align-left>Like with Me2U, to access the <a href=#>code</a> to share data on Airtel, dial *312#, then select the "Gift" or "Share Data" option. Thereafter, select "Data Gifting".</p><h2>How to borrow data from Airtel</h2><p class=align-left>The Airtel credit loan service allows subscribers to borrow<a href=#> data on Airtel</a>. The service allows eligible customers to borrow data on credit and pay it back upon the next recharge. Eligible customers for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Airtel borrow data</a> include the following:</p><ul><li>Airtel prepaid customers with a registered SIM</li><li>Customers who have paid up any previous loan and associated charges</li><li>Customers are also considered based on monthly recharge frequency and average spend</li></ul><p class=align-left>You can check eligibility by dialling *500#. If you are ineligible, you will be prompted to recharge at least N100 monthly to qualify for the service.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8aaa37ed66481744.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Click on add": Google adds Naira card to payment for services on Play Store, gives instruction</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here is how to borrow data on Airtel:</p><ul><li>Simply dial *500# and select 3 for "Borrow Data". (Remember that *500# is the code for Airtel data borrowing)</li></ul><p class=align-left>It is important to note that:</p><ul><li>You can borrow as many times as possible as long as you are within the credit limit.</li><li>You can still borrow even if you have previously borrowed airtime and haven't repaid your loan as long as it is within your credit limit.</li><li>A service charge of 15% is deducted along with the actual amount for the data.</li><li>The loans are recovered when customers recharge their accounts via any channel.</li></ul><h2>How do you share 1GB data from Airtel to Airtel?</h2><p class=align-left>To share 1GB of data, dial *312# and select the option for gifting or Me2U.</p><p class=align-left>Now you have all the information you need concerning how to share data on Airtel. Remember, Me2U allows you to share already purchased bundles, while the gifting service allows you to purchase bundles for another person using your airtime.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b150d04a4e7ea197.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Economic hardship forces Nigerians to abandon SIM cards as 100 million phone lines risk deactivation</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This article is not sponsored by any third party.
