Fans were utterly shocked when McMahon started sporting a mustache earlier this year but have since gotten used to it.</p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>83 Weeks podcast</a>, WWE Hall of Famer Eric Bischoff talked about Vince McMahon’s new look. Bischoff made it clear he is a big fan of the look and stated that McMahon looked like golden age Hollywood actor Errol Flynn.</p><p>”I kind of dug it. It put a smile on my face. The biggest thing I noticed is Vince wasn’t wearing a tie. He’s dying his hair, and he’s dying his mustache. He looks great. I talked to someone recently who said he’s down in the gym working out, you know? In fact, the comment was, ‘If you didn’t know he had just gone through back surgery. You would never have imagined it,’ and that’s Vince McMahon.</p><p>Vince, once again, he looked dapper as f*** in his lavender sport coat, sporting that Errol Flynn mustache.”</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News exclusively reported that&nbsp;</a>Vince McMahon started changing creative week after his spinal surgery. He also&nbsp;<a href=#>returned to the gym after spinal surgery</a>. Regardless, we’ll have to wait and see&nbsp;how McMahon will continue to control WWE in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Eric Bischoff said?
