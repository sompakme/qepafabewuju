The Doctor, as per usual, suggests that she'll be travelling around the universe alone when she is promptly invited to Yas' house for dinner. She quickly accepts, saying: "Definitely! Yes I would. I love tea. Tea at Yaz's, amazing."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">FIRST LOOK: Episode 4 | Arachnids In The UK | Doctor Who</a><p id=eRJ4bvcqgLDZ data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Doctor Who's next episode is not meant for anyone scared of spiders – watch the preview here</a></strong></p><p id=epV5MZuRBaEG data-wc=71>Fans shared their reactions to the video, with one writing: "I love how she's taken so quickly to them and really wants them to stay but is clearly afraid to seem clingy," while another person added: "This is so beautiful.
