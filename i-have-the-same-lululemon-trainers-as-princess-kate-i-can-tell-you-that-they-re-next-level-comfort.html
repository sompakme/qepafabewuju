At first glance, Thursday's look wasn't a "fashion" moment - but then my eyes darted to her footwear. Was Kate wearing my new Lululemon trainers? It appeared so.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeL94_mFt8m data-wc=42>Kate was wearing her white <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Lululemon Chargefeel sports shoes</a> (£128 / $138), and I'm sure she would agree with me - they are the comfiest trainers ever. Scroll down to read my review and why I can't gate keep this any longer...&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7f9ef5fd425-princess-kate-wearing-lululemon.jpg><p id=eufmk2DMpjt data-wc=74>For background, I've always been a Nike girl when it comes to trainers for the gym, but since I've been with a PT and doing strength training, I've come to realise that the shoes you wear really do make a difference. Basically, anytime we embarked on squats and lifting weights, my lovely PT Emma Lawless would ask me to take off my platform Nike trainers, in favour of me being closer to the ground.&nbsp;</p><p id=e39kYabMy59 data-wc=51>When I was asked if I wanted to trial the new Chargefeel 2 trainers from Lululemon, I said yes, though I wasn't overly excited. They looked pretty plain, and I wasn't entirely convinced they'd take me away from my jazzy Nikes, but now I wear them for every single gym session.</p><p id=edOD68o2P6S data-wc=17>Why? Because these sports shoes cater to everything! They've got bounce for running, and agility for training.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/18ea7906a2bd-lululemon-trainers.jpg> <a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">£128 AT LULULEMON</a> <a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">$138 AT LULULEMON</a><p id=eGLzd5ZEND4 data-wc=44>Often in a gym session you do a mix of activities (sometimes I sit and play on my phone, but that's beside the point). More often than not, it's run-first, train-second - and the design of these trainers mirror the way you work out.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKg-awIsdJj data-wc=21>The dual-density midsole is springy enough for running, and agile enough for training, and the pressure-mapped outsole delivers traction and flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaSXonJTv6n data-wc=48>Another of my favourite features about these trainers? How lightweight they are, and the smooth lines equal next-level comfort. I ordered the white pair and I'm happy with my choice, they're a nice bright white and even though I've worn them a lot they still look brand new.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/084a3c7aae97-box-trainers-lululemon-white-chargefeel.jpg><p id=eVXrHzl6dYi data-wc=53>I was quite confused by the sizing as it's US sizing and it's recommended that you size up by half a size if you have wide feet. I'm usually a size 4 in trainers but in my Chargefeel 2, I am a US size 6 (which is a size 4.5 in the UK).&nbsp;</p><p id=e49ksOEckN5 data-wc=50>I told you earlier that I wear these for every gym session, but I also wear them to walk the dog, and I've even been known to work from home in them - they're just that comfy. Now, if Kate fancies doing a workout together, she needs to just call.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Princess Kate's trainer collection: From Superga to Veja, New Balance & More" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cb8b99ac7ebb-princess-kate-trainers-hero.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Princess Kate's trainer collection: From Superga to Veja, New Balance & More" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Princess Kate's trainer collection: From Superga to Veja, New Balance & More</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kate Middleton’s 10 favourite activewear brands" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b017bf1af0d9-kate-middleton-activewear-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kate Middleton’s 10 favourite activewear brands" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kate Middleton’s 10 favourite activewear brands</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
