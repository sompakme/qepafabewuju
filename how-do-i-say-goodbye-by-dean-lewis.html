Dean performed this tune with his father, and it was one of the most emotional moments of my life. I was moved to tears and could hardly keep myself together. I got chills all over my body. I could feel emotions everywhere in the packed hall. It was such a beautiful and touching moment, one that I will never forget.”</p><p><strong>– Martin</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p>Lewis Capaldi and his Dad performing “How Do I Say Goodbye” live in Sydney.</figure><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-i-say-goodbye-a-song-that-highlights-how-fragile-life-is>“How Do I Say Goodbye”, A Song that Highlights How Fragile Life Is</h5><p>“I will never forget the moment when Dean’s ‘How Do I Say Goodbye’ came on the radio during&nbsp;a road&nbsp;trip. I had to pull over to the side of the road. This song was completely new to me at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time, but it hit me real hard. My mother’s cancer has returned after a year of remission, and I am struggling to come to terms with it.</p><p>This song reminded me that we might have to say goodbye to her soon. It’s a challenging time for me right now, and I needed to express how much this song touched me. The song highlights the fragility of life, and how we never know when our time on this earth will be over. It emphasizes that death is inevitable, and yet there is never a right way or time to say goodbye.</p><p>It also reminds me that I am not alone, and many people have gone through the same thing and have found a way to keep going. So, I will keep listening to it, find comfort in its lyrics and hold onto hope even when things seem bleak. I know that someday, somehow, I will find a way to say goodbye to my mother with love and grace.”</p><p><strong>– Phillipa</strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-feels-like-how-do-i-say-goodbye-was-composed-for-me>Feels Like “How Do I Say Goodbye” was Composed for Me</h5><p>“It looks like the duo Dean Lewis and Jon Hume had my family in mind when they composed this song. My husband is dying of cancer, and the disease has spread to his lungs already. It’s a cruel reality we have to face, and we don’t know how to break the news to our kids.</p><p>They don’t deserve this, and my heart breaks at the thought of them growing up without a father. I am worried about how to break the news to the kids and how I will bring them up alone. The emotions I go through whenever I hear it play is unimaginable.”</p><p><strong>– A Heartbroken Mother and Wife &nbsp;</strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-song-that-reminds-me-of-my-greatest-fear-in-life>A Song That Reminds Me of My Greatest Fear In Life</h5><p>“‘How Do I Say Goodbye’ exposes my greatest fear of losing a loved one. It reminds me that life is delicate, and we never know when our time will come to an end. It urges me to hold onto my loved ones, especially my dad, and treasure every moment we have together.</p><p>Despite my dad’s current good health, the song fills me with fear at the thought of losing him someday. I recognize that death is a part of life, and I can only hope to have the courage to face the pain whenever I lose a loved one.”</p><p><strong>– Abena Fosua</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZqGnp2KxsHnIZqqasV2cvLCwwbKcZpqpYrGmrc1mo56vmah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
