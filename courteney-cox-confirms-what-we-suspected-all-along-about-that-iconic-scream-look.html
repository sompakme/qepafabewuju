In a January 10 appearance on "<a href=#>The Drew Barrymore Show</a>," Cox — sitting alongside&nbsp;"Scream" co-stars Neve Campbell and ex-husband David Arquette, the actor explained her character Gale Weathers' evolving hairstyles in the franchise. "Each 'Scream' I would try to come up with a different look for her that was just over the top gross, or ugly or too much," Cox told host Drew Barrymore.&nbsp;Campbell, not missing a beat, immediately asked Cox, "The bangs?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh that was the worst," the TV icon responded. "That was a big lesson in life because that will forever be on film." Apparently, as Cox shared, the bangs were actually clip-ons!

"I remember that day because we were all like, 'No they are good, really,'" Cox said, laughing while Arquette simply added,&nbsp;"I felt so bad for you!"&nbsp;Well, lest they without a single bad old hairdo cast the first stone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtgaX95e8KorKuslaOyunnCqK9mm5%2Bjs6q%2BzKxksKCRqXq4sYysrKyolZjBprCMmqOlZZGhvK%2BzjJqZqK2kYsGprdNmoJynnp6wbr%2FCq5yapV2hvLC3jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
