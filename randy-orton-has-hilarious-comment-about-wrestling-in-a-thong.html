Underwear lines make your ass look like sh*t. Women and gay dudes might enjoy the view don’t ruin it. Get over EVERY way you can. Squating and a thong can do wonders.</p><p>Randy Orton had a very interesting reply to this piece of advice from Storm. He asked whether doing squats in a thong will help him get over. Then he wondered what Lance Storm might have been “tokin.”</p><p>So your saying if I do squats in a thong, I’ll get over? #whatstormbeentokin</p><p>To be fair, Storm clarified his statement to make sure that people know that he meant wrestlers should wear thongs under their tights and not instead of them. However, it seems like he already accidentally planted an idea in too many heads.</p><p>To be clear, the thong goes under the tights, not instead of tights.<br></p><p>We will have to wait and see how Lance Storm’s comment might come back to haunt him in the future. For now, Randy Orton’s reply was one of the more entertaining things we’ve seen in a while.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
