Both of the properties that stand in for the White Lotus chain are Four Seasons properties, with the second season choosing a destination in Italy after production took over a 15-acre estate in fall 2020. The installments also include restaurants and amenities from the hotels.&nbsp;</p><p>Some shots of the scenery from the first two seasons:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4w5aY6DnTHkpTW2bg72oFP-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSQSzYEaGsfAqzyrHzaKeS-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7BjUK7rcim7Us9unpt9cZ-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hp7vuVEfGcZJzScZuRzz7d-1920-80.jpg><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-season-1-hawaii><span>Season 1: Hawaii</span></h3><p>The first season of The White Lotus was filmed at the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/fsmaui/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea</a>in the fall of 2020, with the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-08-06/the-white-lotus-hbo-cast-mike-white-hawaii-resort-tourism referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>production</a> forming a bubble under strict COVID-19 guidelines for several months. The luxury resort, where rooms start around $1,000 a night, includes many of the amenities shown in the series, including the spa, three pools, 81 cabanas, water sports, and snorkeling.&nbsp;It's also steps from Wailea Beach, which was also seen on the show.</p><p>While the series includes colorfully decorated rooms like the Pineapple Suite and the Tradewinds Suite, the real-life rooms are more muted.

Native Hawaiians have pointed out that the hotels receive preferential treatment compared to locals (see the July 2021 <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/03/maui-hawaii-water-shortage/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Maui water shortage</a> where residents were fined for overuse but authorities turned a blind eye to the hotels).
