This looks to be a mounted in a vintage or antique style ring with diamond set shoulders. The mounting looks like it might be in platinum or white gold set on a yellow gold shank, which is typical of the early 1900s. It’s quite possible that this is a family jewel if it is an antique piece. To purchase something like this today from a jeweller would likely set you back $24,000 (£20,000)."</p><p id=eGXXfb7Lbo data-wc=32></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
