We haven't seen them packing on the PDA quite yet. Still, the Illinois-born entertainer has been spotted in the crowd of several of his apparent new lover's concerts lately. For her part, Kelis has been fuelling Instagram with plenty of thirst trap content, leading followers to speculate that she's recruited Murray as her cameraman.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kelis-soaks-up-the-sun>Kelis Soaks Up the Sun</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Thursday (June 15) afternoon, the mother of three shared a video of her laying out in the sun wearing a bikini, looking as radiant as ever. "NATURAL GLOW BODY BUTTER is nourishing, healing, firming and smells divine. Organic and fortified with royal jelly. Hand-whipped to perfection, creamy, and smooth," Kelis wrote in the caption, encouraging fans to check out her skincare brand on its website.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While a few people told the recording artist of their plans to purchase, many took the opportunity to crack jokes at her expense. "I attribute all current and future camerawork to one Bill Murray, until further notice," one person wrote. "She done put some Ensure in Bill milkshake, and he doesn't know how to act now," another quipped.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Social Media Reacts</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to read more of Kelis' follower's reactions to her latest thirst trap.
