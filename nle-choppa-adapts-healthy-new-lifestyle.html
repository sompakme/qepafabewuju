NLE, 20, born Bryson Lashun Potts, arrived on the music scene in 2019 with his 10 song EP, Cottonwood. Cottonwood introduces NLE with hard beats, blunt lyrics and a Memphis twist. His 2019 single “Shotta Flow” featuring <strong>Blueface</strong>, was so successful, that it became <strong>3X platinum</strong> and charted top 40 on Billboard Hot 100,. This demonstrated that NLE was someone not to be taken lightly.</p><span><h2 class=has-large-font-size><strong><a href=# class=text-word>NLE Choppa</a> Is CEO of His Label, No Love Entertainment</strong></h2></span><p>NLE Choppa performs during BIG3 - Week Four at the American Airlines Center. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images for BIG3)</p><p>Taking control of his career, Memphis rapper <a href=# rel>NLE Choppa</a> became the CEO of his personal label, No Love Entertainment. Turning down deals with Republic Records, Interscope Records, and Caroline, the rapper has proved that he is more than adequate at being able to handle his business in the industry. However, NLE did sign an independent distribution deal with <strong>UnitedMasters</strong> with the rights to his masters and publishing. His continued success with hits like “Walk Em Down” featuring <strong>Roddy Rich</strong>, made so many waves that it guaranteed him a spot on <strong>XXL’s 2020 Freshman Class</strong> alongside Fivio Foreign, Baby Keem, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Polo G</a>.</p><span><h2 class=has-large-font-size><strong>From Music to Meditation</strong></h2></span><p>Mozzy and NLE Choppa attend 2021 Revolt Summit at 787 Windsor. (Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)</p><p>Lately, NLE has been up to more than just making aggressive lyrical flows. Implementing a new healthy routine into his life, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NLE says</a>, “<strong>To Be A Champion You Have To Start Your Day Like One</strong>.” Recently making videos of his healing remedies on TikTok and Instagram, fans get to see inside how he stays his spirited self.</p><p>Starting his day off with morning meditation, NLE spends time in the sun to resonate with his surroundings and ground his aura. He uses an amethyst crystal, used for serenity and manifesting calm emotions, to clear his space. Being that NLE is a water sign in the astrological world, as he’s a Scorpio, NLE says he keeps his crystal in a seashell to bring it closer to its abilities.</p><span><h2 class=has-large-font-size id=h-nle-stays-dedicated-to-his-healthy-lifestyle><strong>NLE Stays Dedicated to His Healthy Lifestyle</strong></h2></span><p>Next, NLE <strong>uses sage</strong> to remove any negative energy around him and his surroundings. Sage is used to enhance cognitivity <strong>and protect the body</strong> against unwanted energies. He lights it, pointing up, of course, to keep its positivity, and proceeds to let its aroma and smoke envelope his body to release its tension and balance his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>After NLE clears his energy, he makes a <strong>homemade pot of lemon and ginger tea</strong>. Filling the pot up halfway with water, he infuses it over the stove with lemon and ginger slices. This type of tea <strong>reduces the intake of toxins in the body</strong>, protects the body from inflammation, helps digestion, congestion and serves as a very tasty ritual to include in his healthy lifestyle. For reference, the tea should come to a full boil, then reduce the heat to let the lemons and ginger infuse their flavor for at least 15 minutes. This also allows the organic qualities of the tea to take root when you drink it.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=has-large-font-size><strong>NLE Changes His Diet to Vegan</strong></h2></span><p>NLE also makes sure to keep a strict <strong>vegan diet</strong>, only eating fruits and vegetables. For breakfast, he makes a hearty smoothie with strawberries and blueberries. Eating fruits like grapefruit and <strong>plant-based products</strong> to increase physical energy, he is then able to work out by lifting weights and running.&nbsp;</p><p>He also takes good care of his appearance by keeping his skin hydrated with facial products and<strong> clay masks</strong>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NLE says</a> he may hate the struggle, but it’s essentially made him "<strong>harder</strong>." This is no surprise, as the healthy routine he uses includes rigorous practices that take patience, time, and dedication to not only begin, but keep them as an everyday habit <strong>to increase the quality of your health</strong>.</p><span><h2 class=has-large-font-size><strong>NLE Choppa Suffers Loss of Son with Ex-Girlfriend</strong></h2></span><p>Mozzy, NLE Choppa and Royce Da 5'9 attend 2021 Revolt Summit at 787 Windsor. (Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)</p><p>Though NLE has changed his lifestyle, the journey to this new road wasn’t easy.<strong> In</strong> <strong>2022</strong> he and ex-girlfriend, Marissa Da’Nae, announced that their son, Seven had <strong>passed away due a miscarriage</strong>. This could very well have influenced his decision to become more balanced and spiritual.&nbsp;</p><p>After the passing of their son, NLE took to the studio to transform his pain into devotion by writing song, “The Gender Reveal Song,” where he raps about how he would have cared for his son or daughter. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Singing</a>, “Love her or love him, every decision is made for them. God should be the only one you put above them. When you hold them in your hand, I swear you can’t unlove them.” Though he and the mother of Seven are no longer together, NLE has shown Marissa his support through their grieving process.</p><p>As for his latest release, “Do It Again” featuring <strong>2Rare</strong>, his<strong> hard delivery is embodied impeccably</strong>.&nbsp;As he continues to stay healthy with his meditative practices, fans should anticipate a stronger, focused, and leveled up NLE, as the benefits of his new lifestyle are very powerful and positive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIV3fJhmpaWdXZi1sLzPmmSanJGlwbR5x56YpayYrnqvsdZmo6KelajBurjE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
