 Answer
 Organize your freezer by putting food that has already been placed in it to one side; aim to allow approximately 1 cubic foot of freezer space for every 2 to 3 pounds of deer. [It is recommended to utilise a big, empty chest freezer in order to allow for the most air circulation possible for the best and quickest freezing results.]
