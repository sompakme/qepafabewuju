"Due to so many melanomas in one area, they are worried to cut in there and try to remove because they aren't sure what they would be cutting into," she explained. The reality TV star went on to say that despite the roadblock, she and her doctors set up a new plan –– which included getting a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to see how far the cancer has spread. "Once you have a better understanding of the disease, the next step is talking about your treatment," she added.</p><p>In a follow-up <a href=#>s</a><a href=#>ocial media post</a>, Mellencamp revealed the results of her PET scan and said that the doctors think she's "predisposed to melanomas." She explained, "I will need wide encision surgery removal and nodal mapping. During the surgery, they will also do a sentinel lymphnoid biopsy." Towards the end of her post, the TV personality revealed that her surgery was scheduled for October 25. In addition to the procedure, she'll also be meeting with a geneticist to try and receive a BRCA2 mutation. "Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. Please go get checked," she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmZ350hY6rn6iamGKurcHMZquenJSeeq6xy6Wcp5uRor1uvNGoraKclah6trzSnqutoZ6cera8w5qrnmWfo3qkrc2cnKtllJ6uqLrOrKCsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
