(Tillman left a career in the NFL to serve as a U.S. Army Ranger in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States; he died in 2004 at just 27 years old as a result of friendly fire.) The controversy surrounding his selection for the award <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-stunned-by-espy-award-backlash/>apparently left Harry "stunned,"</a> but, said former royal butler Grand Harrold, Harry and Meghan are no doubt “drowning out the outside noise” as Harry prepares to accept the award this evening in a ceremony hosted by Meghan’s friend <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/serena-williams/>Serena Williams</a>.</p><p>The Sussexes are “very used to the criticism, given everything that’s gone on over the last few years,” Harrold said, per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://okmagazine.com/p/prince-harry-meghan-markle-drowning-out-critics-pat-tillman/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>OK</u></a>. “I’m sure they’ll be drowning out the outside noise by continuing with their normal and everyday life and trying not to turn on the television, or read the papers as much. They’re being talked about constantly, given their profiles.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MeEM3H4Np55SHvEexEvwr4-1920-80.jpg><p>Harrold—who worked for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/king-charles/>King Charles</a> (who was then Prince Charles) for several years—doesn’t think the backlash is getting to Harry: “From what I remember, Harry was always an extremely private person, so I’m not sure how he’ll feel about that—but I can imagine his way of coping with the attention is to carry on as normal,” Harrold said.</p><p>The former butler added of Harry that “He’d never want to cause any upset,” he said. “If he thinks that it is going to cause upset, then it is quite likely that he could decline the award—because he’d never want to cause any upset, and it would affect him hearing about the backlash.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWA3K4Musq7vpgJr4K6PLZ-1920-80.jpg><p>Reports indicate that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-has-no-plans-to-turn-down-tillman-award/><u>Harry has no plans to decline the award</u></a>, given by ESPN; the network <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/espn-defends-selection-of-prince-harry-for-pat-tillman-award/><u>defended Harry after the brouhaha</u></a> ensued following his selection, saying that Harry’s Invictus Games were “a cause worth celebrating,” per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1921925/prince-harry-meghan-markle-espy-award-backlash referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Express</u></a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
