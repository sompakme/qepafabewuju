However, there is a possibility that the show might return in the future, as the creator Anna McRoberts has expressed her interest in continuing the story.&nbsp;She said in an interview with Kidscreen&nbsp;that she has “a lot of ideas for season three and beyond”. She also said that she hopes to explore more of the parallel world and the history of the Pup Academy.</p><p>If the show gets renewed, it might take some time before it arrives on the screens, as the production process has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The show involves a lot of live-action filming with real dogs, which requires special precautions and protocols. The show also uses CGI and animation to create the magical effects and the talking dogs, which takes a lot of time and resources.</p><p>Based on these factors, we can expect the show to return in early 2025, if it gets greenlit. This is just an estimation and not an official confirmation. We will update this section as soon as we get any official news about the renewal or cancellation of the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Global_Release_Time></span><strong>Global Release Time</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The show is available on Netflix, which means that it can be streamed anytime and anywhere, depending on the availability of the service in your region.

However, based on the previous seasons, we can speculate on what might happen next. The show follows the adventures of Morgan, a boy who discovers a magical portal to a parallel world where dogs are trained to become man’s best friend. He meets Spark, a stray boxer who is destined to save the bond between humans and canines, as prophesied by the Canis Primus constellation. Along with their friends Izzy, Corazon, and Whiz, they face various challenges and enemies, such as Professor Fitz, Wolf, and the Shadow Pack.</p><p>In the second season, Morgan and Spark learn more about the history of the Pup Academy and the prophecy. They also discover that Charlie, the janitor of the academy, is actually the Dean of Graduates (D.O.G.), who has been hiding his identity for a long time. They also meet King, the leader of the Shadow Pack, who is revealed to be Spark’s father. King wants to destroy the Pup Academy and the bond between humans and canines, as he believes that dogs are better off without humans.</p><p>He also tries to lure Spark to join his side, but Spark refuses. In the final episode, Morgan and Spark manage to stop King and his plan, with the help of Charlie, Izzy, Corazon, Whiz, and the other pups. They also restore the Canis Primus constellation and the bond between humans and canines. The episode ends with Morgan and Spark graduating from the Pup Academy and becoming official dogs.</p><p>In the third season, we can expect to see more of Morgan and Spark’s adventures in the parallel world, as they continue to learn and grow as dogs. We can also expect to see more of their friends and enemies, as well as new characters and challenges. We might also see more of the backstory and secrets of the Pup Academy and the parallel world, as well as the origin and purpose of the prophecy. We might also see more of the relationship between Morgan and his mother Molly, who is unaware of his secret life. We might also see more of the conflict between King and Spark, as well as the fate of the Shadow Pack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pup-Academy-Season-3-release-date.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_storylines_of_this_series></span><strong>What are the storylines of this series?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The storyline of the show is as follows:</p><p>Pup Academy is a Disney show that follows the adventures of Charlie, a man who runs a puppy school in a parallel dimension.
