 Susie Salmon from Alice Sebold’s novel The Lovely Bones. Although no one would ever desire for Susie Salmon’s character to be based on a real-life occurrence, the novel is based on the murder of a little girl in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the 1970s, which inspired the novel.
It is true that the rapist in The Lovely Bones is a combination of numerous real-life serial rapists and murders, but the author, Alice Sebold, was once raped in a tunnel where she discovered that another victim had been sexually assaulted and dismembered, therefore the novel is inspired by genuine events."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
