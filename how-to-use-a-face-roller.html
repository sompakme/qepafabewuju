Yushi Gunlun, as it is known in Chinese, is a small handheld wand made of jade stone. "Facial rolling with precious gemstones such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jade</a> and rose quartz was used by the wealthy and elite, they believed the stones held beneficial healing and anti-aging powers," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, face rollers can be found in various shapes, sizes, and materials, with each boasting different benefits. And although the concept of face rolling seems quite simple, if you've stood in front of the mirror and wondered, "Is this working?" you're not alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To understand a bit more about face rollers, we asked Caroline to share some tips on the best way to enhance any beauty regimen using the technique.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-a-face-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use a Face Roller</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've just bought a face roller, the tendency to overdo the rolling is always there. Of course, we all want to see optimum results, but unfortunately, gliding a face roller over the skin for hours will only leave you with an aching arm. The steps below tell you how to get the most out of your face roller, in just 10 minutes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step One: Cleanse</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Always clean your face before you use your face roller. "Cleansing first is very important as you do not want to push any bacteria into the skin," says Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Two: Moisturize</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apply a hydrating face serum, followed by a gentle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face oil</a>. "You want to make sure the oil is designed to be used on the face," she says. "I like using the serum for product penetration, and the oil for glide."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Three: Start From the Inner Cheek</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starting from the inner cheek, directly under the eye, use the smaller end of your jade or quartz double-ended tool, and gently roll outward toward the temple. "Make sure to do this three times on each side," recommends Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Four: Move Onto the Lower Portion of the Face</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the lower portion of the face, use the larger stone on the opposite end of your roller, she explains. "Continue with three outward sweeping motions, till you feel the tension in your face start to release."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Five: Move To the Neck</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Move onto your neck, working gently in an upward motion. "Start under the jawbone and roll out towards the inner ear," instructs Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Six: Move To the Forehead</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finish by applying light upward strokes from the brow bone to the hairline. "Pay special attention to the tension in the brow area and gently roll there for a few extra seconds," says Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Seven: Clean</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To prevent breakouts and transferring bacteria onto your face, clean your roller before and after using it. This can be done with a damp cloth or alcohol wipes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO</strong>: <strong>A Face Massage Might Be the Best Thing You Can Do For Yourself Today</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-face-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Benefits of Using a Face Roller?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While facial rolling may not reveal immediate results, the light pressure applied helps to stimulate blood circulation, which can lessen the appearance of fine lines and tighten the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, keep in mind that facial rollers are most effective when used with a serum or moisturizer as they help the skin to actively absorb key ingredients deep into the facial tissue, enhancing hydration and contributing to brighter-looking skin. Other benefits include lymphatic drainage and reduced inflammation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-facial-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get the Most Out of Your Facial Roller</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Add a Face Mask</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take your face massage to the next level by applying a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sheet mask</a>. Not only is this super relaxing, but the facial roller helps all the goodness from the mask to penetrate deep into the skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Be Gentle</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don't push too hard. I know what you're thinking, "Maybe if I apply more pressure on the facial roller, I'll see better results." Unfortunately, extra pressure doesn't have any effect. "The lymph system is very delicate, and a light touch is all you need," says Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Create a Ritual</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The repetitive motion of rolling a face roller can be therapeutic. Take your time, there's no rush. "Practice deep breathing while doing it, and create a beautiful ritual around it," suggests Caroline.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Keep it Cold</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The muscles in the face tend to store a lot of tension which can cause wrinkles and fine lines. Keeping your face roller in the fridge can help reap maximum skin tightening benefits while de-puffing the skin and soothing irritations.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-face-rollers-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Face Rollers Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, face rolling looks great, and it definitely sounds soothing, but after standing in the mirror using the roller for 10 minutes, are you going to see any results? "Honestly, facial rolling feels fantastic on your skin and is definitely recommended. However, keep in mind that it is not a life-changing treatment," says Caroline. "I advise being realistic with your expectations before you start facial rolling. Whenever my clients ask me this question, I always stress the benefits of any facial massage that can be turned into a ritual, which is exactly how facial rolling should be viewed. Facial rolling helps us be mindful of our skin, and our skincare, and for that reason, I love it."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-face-rollers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop Face Rollers</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nurse-jamie-healthy-skin-solutions-uplift-massaging-beauty-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nurse Jamie Healthy Skin Solutions Uplift Massaging Beauty Roller</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This face roller is a big celebrity favorite, so you've probably seen it all over Instagram.
