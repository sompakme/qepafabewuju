And now, our favorite dysfunctional family has gone international, with crew&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/waystarceo/status/1401783526802923523 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>revealing</a>&nbsp;they headed to Italy for the tail-end of the season. From release date to plot, here's everything we know so far about&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;season 3.</p><h2 id=where-did-season-2-of-xa0-succession-xa0-leave-off-3>Where did season 2 of&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;leave off?</h2><p>Succession&nbsp;season 2 ended with Kendall Roy lobbing a bombshell on his father's dynasty, naming Logan Roy as "a malignant presence, a bully and a liar." The Number One Boy chose to betray media tycoon Logan Roy—who set up his son to take the fall for Waystar Royco's wrongdoings—throwing a major wrench into the patriarch's plans for his heirs. Roman Roy also ascended to COO of the company, while Cousin Greg, clutching those ever-incriminating emails, drew his battle lines and aligned with Kendall.</p><h2 id=what-apos-s-going-to-happen-in-season-3-3>What's going to happen in season 3?</h2><p>A statement from HBO teased that season three would be a guns-blazing battle between the Roys. "Ambushed by his rebellious son Kendall at the end of Season 2, Logan Roy begins Season 3 in a perilous position," the official synopsis reads. "Scrambling to secure familial, political, and financial alliances, tensions rise as a bitter corporate battle threatens to turn into a family civil war."</p><p>For more specific details, you'd have to ask Brian Cox. In an interview with&nbsp;The Jess Cagle Show,&nbsp;the actor revealed that he was the first cast member to know what the new season would hold. "I nearly fell off my chair because [show creator Jesse Armstrong] never tells you about the next series. We never knew from episode to episode what was going to happen," Cox said, per&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brian-cox-says-he-alone-knows-succession-season-3-secrets-1307051 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It's jolly thrilling. That's all I can say."</p><p>An in-depth profile published in&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.vulture.com/article/succession-season-three.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>August 2021 on&nbsp;Vulture</a>&nbsp;revealed a few more vague but still intriguing details about the upcoming season, including why COVID won't play a major factor into the show's plot. Spoiler: It's because the Roys are capital-R Rich. “These are really wealthy people,” actress Sarah Snook (Shiv) said to the outlet. “And unfortunately, none of the world’s really wealthy people were going to be affected by the pandemic.”</p><p>It also explains why the Roys were able to easily pick up and decamp to Italy in the third season for, as&nbsp;Vulture&nbsp;describes it, an overly lavish trip in Tuscany complete with regal estate and tense family dinners. Despite how season 2 left off, Kendall and Greg are also in attendance at the Italian villa so we must wonder: Is all well in Roy-land? (Doubtful.) Some of the meager clues we're given about the season: Shiv gives an impromptu speech; Tom gets an interesting phone call; the Roy siblings have a group lunch (even Connor is present); Logan Roy (Brian Cox) has a tense nine-page scene; there's a party that includes a dance floor; and the third season picks up "moments" after the second ended.</p><p>"Logan is still in charge of Waystar Royco, and there’s a shareholder revolt on the horizon. The same essential drama repeats itself, with Kendall, Roman, and Shiv trying to outsmart the others at Dad’s game and take over the company,"&nbsp;Vulture&nbsp;reports.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

And for Shiv and Tom, their marriage will be tested more than ever before, Armstrong teased, thanks to the Roy civil war “[pulling] them in different directions.”</p><h2 id=when-does-xa0-succession-xa0-season-3-premiere-3>When does&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;season 3 premiere?</h2><p>On August 23, HBO confirmed on social media that the show would be back—not in December as expected—but in October 2021. And in mid-September, HBO announced that&nbsp;<strong>episode 1 of the third season would drop on October 17.</strong></p><p>October will be two years to the month that the second season's finale hit the streamer. But the extended length between seasons isn't surprising considering HBO announced in March 2020 that preproduction had been delayed due to the pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f5GhMV52GTnDJiPNc2pCBL-1920-80.jpeg><h2 id=how-can-i-watch-xa0-succession-xa0-season-3-2>How can I watch&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;season 3?</h2><p>It's time to renew that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/hbo-max/>HBO Max</a> subscription.&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;will be available on HBO and streaming on HBO Max beginning at 9 PM ET on Sunday, October 17. Season 3 will be a shortened nine-episode run (instead of the standard 10) with its finale slated for December 12.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-xa0-succession-xa0-season-3-2>Is there a trailer for&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;season 3?</h2><p>First, there was an HBO Max teaser that confirmed, yes,&nbsp;Succession&nbsp;is coming before 2022.</p><p>In June, HBO further teased fans by releasing exactly three seconds of new footage hidden in an<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/OCjA/hbo-max-all-in-one-place-new-premiere-every-month referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;</a><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/OCjA/hbo-max-all-in-one-place-new-premiere-every-month referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>ad for HBO Max</a>. While it's very little to go on, we do see a rarity: a smiling Kendall Roy. The clip also shows Logan Roy yelling, "It's war!"—fitting based on the descriptions of the season thus far.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>New footage from #Succession season 3 pic.twitter.com/H8XtSJAUal<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1409489130363498499 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>June 28, 2021</a></p><p>Then, finally, came a glorious minute-plus teaser for the season. In the new footage, we see Logan yelling (what's new?), Kendall giving zero fucks, Shiv making power moves, the FBI raiding Waystar Royco, and Cousin Greg being set up as the fall guy for Kendall's decisions in season 2. Let's not forget the best part of the trailer: Tom screaming at Greg, "Logan is going to fire a million poisonous spiders down your dicky."</p><p>Ultimately, the trailer shows us the battle lines being drawn, as each Roy family member is forced to choose sides no matter the casualties. Let the fun begin!</p><p>HBO also released a fierce season 3 poster on Instagram which took the "battle lines being drawn" concept to a very literal level. In the image—captioned with, "Make your move"—the Roys walk through an office with a stripe running down the hallway; Logan, Shiv, Tom, and Connor stand on one side with Kendall, Greg, and Roman appearing on the other. It may be the biggest hint yet about how the season will play out.</p><p>But eagle-eyed fans spotted something peculiar about the poster: In a version uploaded to Twitter, Shiv and Connor appear behind Kendall and Roman stands behind Logan. A Photoshop mistake or a&nbsp;major&nbsp;hint from HBO about the Roy siblings' general lack of loyalty? More than likely, season 3 will show Shiv and the rest flip-flopping between their brother and dad based on whomever promises the more appealing endgame.</p><p>And then, finally, the full trailer arrived. Prepare to go "full fucking beast."</p><p>The trailer picks up where season 2 ended, with Greg and Kendall leaving Kendall's explosive press conference. (Kendall's trending on Twitter!) We also see Logan reeling in the aftermath of the conference because, instead of rallying around him, the rest of his family has "disappeared." We then get glimpses of Kendall meeting with a lawyer to figure out how to "take down" his dad without implicating himself or worrying stakeholders—but Logan won't be making that easy. "There's blood in the water. Sharks are coming," Logan teases. Meanwhile, Shiv panics about losing the company, Roman ponders the eventual death of dear ol' dad, Connor makes power moves, Tom tries to reconnect with Shiv, and Greg is, well, classic Greg. Come for the drama, stay for the sweeping vistas of Italy.</p><p>If that wasn't enough excitement for you, HBO also shared more promo posters of the main cast, this time pairing our favorite duos together. Just try not to get hot under the collar looking at this shot of Gerri Kellman and Roman Roy:</p><p>Is this our unofficial confirmation that Gerri and Roman are together next season?!</p><p>Meanwhile, this poster of Tom and Greg is our official confirmation that you can't make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs.</p><h2 id=who-will-be-in-season-3-3>Who will be in season 3?</h2><p>All of the show's key players—Brian Cox as dastardly patriarch Logan Roy; Jeremy Strong as Kendall Roy; and Sarah Snook and Matthew Macfadyen as troubled newlyweds Shiv Roy and Tom Wambsgans—have been spotted filming, so it's safe to assume the cast will remain largely intact. Cox, in particular, teased Kieran Culkin's return as his youngest son: "I’m fascinated to see how young Roman comes into play. He showed his mettle at the end of season two. I think he's the hidden gun under the table," Cox told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/succession-hbo-brian-cox-donald-trump-boris-johnson-1202805405/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a>.</p><p>Big things also seem to be coming for Braun as fan-favorite Cousin Greg. The actor posted a photo of himself, clad in a Kendall Roy-esque suit posing in front of a Waystar Royco logo, to Instagram. He captioned it seemingly with a major spoiler, writing, "I am an employee of this company, and that’s about all I can say about that!" How very Greg of him.</p><p>Season 3 is also adding some bold-faced names to its roster. Oscar winner Adrien Brody has been tapped to play Josh Aaronson "a billionaire activist investor who becomes pivotal in the battle for the ownership of Waystar," per&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/succession-season-3-hbo-adrien-brody-1234967174/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a>.

Reviewer Jen Chaney also notes that while the season doesn't truly its stride until episode 3, it definitely makes a case as one of the funniest shows on television. Fuck yes.</p><h2 id=will-there-be-a-season-4-of-xa0-succession-2>Will there be a season 4 of&nbsp;Succession?</h2><p>On October 26, HBO officially greenlit a fourth season of the family drama (what was long suspected and teased already).</p><p>Francesca Orsi, executive vice president of HBO Programming, said in a statement obtained by&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/succession-season-4-renewed-hbo-1235097333/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a>, “With each season of&nbsp;Succession, Jesse Armstrong has continued to surpass our wildest expectations, pulling us deeper into the Roy family’s inner sanctum with indelible wit, humanity, and precision.
