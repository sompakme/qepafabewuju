But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it's really hard not to be upset," Colon said.</p><p>He isn't alone. The label also&nbsp;<a href=#>received criticism</a>&nbsp;after Season 5 winner Tessanne Chin's album was underpromoted. Season 6 winner Josh Kaufman only released one album, and Season 7 winner Craig Wayne Boyd has not release a full-length album to date. Season 8 champ Sawyer Fredericks released two albums that didn't chart.</p><p>There's never really been a Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, or even a Ruben Studdard from&nbsp;The Voice,&nbsp;and that problem is so glaring that even the coaches are sick of talking about it.&nbsp;Adam Levine told&nbsp;<a href=#>Billboard</a>, "Eventually,&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;is going to have to launch somebody into the stratosphere to continue to be taken seriously." Pharrell Williams was a bit more defensive, telling&nbsp;<a href=#>TV Guide</a>, "The show is not about someone signing a record deal and getting signed. The show is about a bunch of people who really care about people that they encounter, and make sure that they're changed when they walk off."
