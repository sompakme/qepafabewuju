Littlefinger may be the most dangerous man in Westeros.
Sunday’s Game of Thrones dropped a Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) bombshell that puts the events of the entire series in a new light.
At the Vale we learned that Lysa Arryn (Kate Dickie) was the one who poisoned her husband, Jon Arryn, and that she did so at Littlefinger’s request."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Littlefinger was also behind Lysa’s pilot episode letter to Catelyn in which the widow accused Cersei of murdering her husband.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Q&A: ‘Game of Thrones’ Director Says Jon Snow Bloodbath Was ‘Justified Violence</strong></a></p><p>The significance of the revelation cannot be overstated. The death of Jon — then hand of the king — put the entire series in motion. Eddard became hand, investigated Jon’s death and in the process discovered Cersei’s incestuous relationship with Jaime. It didn’t take long for him to lose his head and for his death to spark the War of the Five Kings.</p><p>Tens of thousands have died because of the events Littlefinger set in motion, with the dead including our beloved Starks and the evil Joffrey. And it seems Lord Baelish is just getting started. Sunday’s episode saw him continue to amass power, marrying Lysa and becoming Lord Protector of the Vale.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lysa and sheltered son Robin (<strong>Lino Facioli</strong>) proved to be as creepy as ever, with the new Mrs. Baelish accusing her niece of sleeping with Littlefinger and plotting for her to marry Robin. Poor Sansa (<strong>Sophie Turner</strong>) really can’t catch a break.</p><p>For more on Littlefinger’s big reveal, read <a href=#>THR‘s Q&A with director Michelle MacLaren.</a></p><p>Back in King’s Landing, Westeros crowned a new king, with young Tommen (<strong>Dean-Charles Chapman</strong>) celebrating his coronation. Cersei (<strong>Lena Headey</strong>) spoke candidly with Margaery (<strong>Natalie Dormer</strong>) about Joffrey, admitting she recognized “exactly what he was.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: ‘Game of Thrones’: 20 Best Quotes</strong></a></p><p>“What he did — it shocked me,” Cersei said. “Do you think I am easily shocked?”</p><p>Cersei made a surprising overture to the young Tyrell woman, asking if she would still be interested in marrying Tommen.</p><p>“I won’t even know what to call you. Sister — or mother?”&nbsp;Margaery said.</p><p>Cersei did not uphold her <a href=#>old threat</a> to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she called her sister — and with good reason. The Lannisters need the Tyrells. As Tywin (<strong>Charles Dance</strong>) later revealed, the crown is broken. Their mines are dry, and the crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a “tremendous amount of money.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Aaron/Game%20of%20Thrones/Week%205/Tommen.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Joffrey’s 10 Most Evil Moments</strong></a></p><p>Daenerys (<strong>Emilia Clarke</strong>) made a brief but significant appearance in the episode. Two of the cities she freed have shifted back to slavery, so Dany pledged to stay in the East rather than return to Westeros (at least for the time being).</p><p>“I will not let the cities I have freed slide back into chains,” she said. “I will do what queens do; I will rule.”</p><p>Meanwhile, The Hound (<strong>Rory McCann</strong>) continued to teach Arya (<strong>Maisie Williams</strong>) his life philosophy, which can be boiled down to this: “Brutality keeps you alive.” He mocked the memory of Syrio Forel and smacked Arya for attempting to drive Needle into his chest.</p><p>“Your friend is dead, and Meryn Trant is not because Trant had armor and a big f—ing sword,” he said of Syrio’s death at the hands of Ser Meryn.</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Daenerys’ 10 Fiercest Moments</strong></a></p><p>North of the Wall, justice was served to the horrible mutineers, with Jon (<strong>Kit Harington</strong>) leading the charge at Craster’s Keep. Meera (<strong>Ellie Kendrick</strong>) was spared from a brutal assault thanks to Jon’s attack. But before that, Jojen (<strong>Thomas Brodie-Sangster</strong>) attempted to save his sister by offering his powers of sight to Karl (<strong>Burn Gorman</strong>).</p><p>“Have you seen what I’m going to do to your sister?” Karl asked Jojen.</p><p>Jojen’s response: “I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn.”</p><p>Shortly after Karl left, Bran (<strong>Isaac Hempstead Wright</strong>) and his friends were terrorized by Locke (<strong>Noah Taylor</strong>). Luckily, Hodor (<strong>Kristian Nairn</strong>) saved the day — with an assist from Bran inhabiting his body. Somewhere Jaime must have been celebrating.</p><p>Afterward, Bran had to make the heartbreaking decision to remain hidden from Jon, who would have put a stop to his trek north.</p><p>Jon, meanwhile, had his hands full with Karl. The two expert fighters duked it out, with Karl upholding his reputation as a Gin Alley legend. But Jon ultimately prevailed when one of Craster’s wives stabbed Karl in the back, giving Jon a chance to strike a fatal blow.</p><p>The episode ended with Craster’s Keep in flames and his wives deciding to make it on their own, rejecting help from Jon as men had never brought them anything but suffering.</p><p>That’s it for this week, but what do you think is coming next?</p><p>We didn’t see any of Tyrion this episode, but it’s high time for his trial to begin. We’re also waiting for Davos to reveal his big plan that was teased last week. With the crown in debt, it would make sense for Stannis to seek out the Iron Bank of Braavos’ backing.</p><p>Share your theories in the comments, and stay tuned to <a href=# rel=nofollow>THR.com/GoT</a> for everything Game of Thrones-related.</p><p>Email: Aaron.Couch@THR.com<br>Twitter: @AaronCouch</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJimnV2ptbO7zZ6qZqqVmK6xecuiq62klZu2r7PEq2Srnaaarq2%2FjHBnamlibHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
