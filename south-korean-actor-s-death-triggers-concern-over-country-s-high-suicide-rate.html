Actor Jeon Tae-su, who had been making inroads in the entertainment scene after appearing in TV dramas such as Sungkyunkwan Scandal, was found dead at the age of 34 on Sunday, which his agency Haewadal Entertainment confirmed in a statement released to the press on Monday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ha went on to cancel her commitments for the upcoming film Manhunt, a press event for which was scheduled in Seoul on Monday.</p><p align=left>Meanwhile, industry watchers have reacted strongly to the news, as it occurred not long after the tragic suicide of K-Pop star Kim <span data-scayt_word=Jonghyun data-scaytid=11>Jonghyun</span>. Better known as <span data-scayt_word=Jonghyun data-scaytid=57>Jonghyun</span> of <span data-scayt_word=SHINee data-scaytid=13>SHINee</span>, a boy band with a broad fan base across <a href=# id=auto-tag_asia data-tag=asia>Asia</a>, Kim also reportedly suffered from depression before he took his own life on Dec. 18. He was only 27.</p><p align=left><span data-scayt_word="Jonghyun's" data-scaytid=65>Jonghyun’s</span> death reignited nationwide concern over suicide in South Korea. Among OECD countries, it has had the highest suicide rate since 2003, with an average of one person taking his/her life every 40 seconds. The most recent statistic provided by local authorities showed that more than 13,000 Koreans committed suicide in 2016.</p><p align=left>On Tuesday, Korea’s minister of health and welfare, Park <span data-scayt_word=Neunghoo data-scaytid=14>Neunghoo</span>, announced plans for a program to prevent and curb suicides, for which he has set aside a budget of about $15.2 million (16.2 billion Korean won) for the initiative.</p><p align=left>Meanwhile, psychologist and political commentator Leo Sang Min <span data-scayt_word=Whang data-scaytid=15>Whang</span> pointed out larger concerns regarding such high-profile deaths implicating suicide.</p><p align=left>“In case of both <span data-scayt_word=Jeon data-scaytid=16>Jeon</span> and <span data-scayt_word=Jonghyun data-scaytid=17>Jonghyun</span>, both of their agencies pointed out the fact that they suffered from depression. This disturbs me because it suggests that the reason for their suicide — or possible suicide for <span data-scayt_word=Jeon data-scaytid=96>Jeon</span> — was a personal reason and choice. But one has to wonder whether these giant entertainment companies were fully supportive of their artists,” <span data-scayt_word=Whang data-scaytid=18>Whang</span> told <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=23>THR</span>.</p><p align=left>“Another problem is how suicides are largely met with silence in Korea,” he added. “Koreans tend to sweep things under the rug and prefer not to talk about it. This does not allow for a healthy discourse and debate, which are necessary to solve any given problem — especially such a grave one like suicide.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLS71K2fZqOfp7Kiuoyamq2noqh6pbHArZ9mrKKetKix0axknKeemLKzuoycpq6mpKfGtHnHop6hZaOqtqS1w55kq5mkmnpyfJZvb29pXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
