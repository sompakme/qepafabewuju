Amid the celebrity client cameos and dog birthday parties, the show also brought on two new agents to the Oppenheim Group: former soap opera star Vanessa Villela and food industry CEO turned realtor Emma Hernan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hernan, who has worked for the brokerage since 2018, comes onto the show with an extra dose of drama, thanks to a rocky past connection with Christine Quinn. Here's everything we know about the show's newest broker.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She's a former model and CEO of a food company.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hernan, 30, was born and raised in the beach town of Scituate, Massachusetts, and her family owned a seafood company. As a teenager, she worked as a model and a babysitter, and started investing in the stock market. She is now bicoastal, living between LA and Boston, and works as a real estate agent and as CEO of her plant-based empanada company, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/emmaleighandco_/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Leigh & Co." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emma Leigh & Co.</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She's worked for the Oppenheim Group for years.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The realtor first worked with Brett and Jason Oppenheim when she was looking for a house herself in 2017. Her now boss Jason encouraged her to get a real estate license, and she later joined the Oppenheim Group in 2018, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/home/all-about-selling-sunsets-newest-leading-lady-emma-hernan-im-excited-to-open-up-my-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>. She told the outlet that her connections from her other career has helped her real estate career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Being in the food industry is a huge part of my story and also transitioning into real estate. A lot of the ties that I made from that — and from being a woman CEO and a woman entrepreneur — mean I've met other CEOs who are now purchasing homes. So you'll see it unfold [on screen], but it makes a big difference, me coming on and having that entrepreneurial background, for sure."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nylon.com/life/emma-hernan-selling-sunset-new-cast-member data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Nylon class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Nylon</a>, Hernan reflected on joining the show. "When I signed on to do the show, I was definitely... not hesitant, but I didn’t know exactly what I was signing up for, and to be honest, it’s been very second nature to me. I’m very comfortable with the cameras around. I’m 100% myself, whether it's on camera, off camera and I think it's important to stay genuine to who you are."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She has a 4-year-old rescue dog named Benny.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The star is a devoted dog mom to Benny, an Akita mix who she rescued from a kill shelter. She also rescued the pup's brother, and gave him to her aunt in Boston. Here's hoping the pup will make a cameo on Selling Sunset.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She's close friends with Chrishell Stause and Mary Fitzgerald.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hernan told People that she became close with Fitzgerald after meeting her through the Oppenheim twins, whom she's also friends with outside of the office. "I think I would probably say I'm closest with Mary [Fitzgerald] and Chrishell [Stause], but that's nothing against anyone else. I just happened to know them prior to even getting super involved in real estate."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"From the moment that I met Jason and Brett and everyone, started looking at real estate and then was involved in the office, we were hanging out all the time. So, the majority of the weekends we were doing stuff together," she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also opened up to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a38323972/emma-hernan-selling-sunset/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Women's Health" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Women's Health</a> about her friendship with Chrishell. "Me and Chrishell really really bonded," she said. "I trust Chrishell with my whole heart and tell her things about my life that you would only share with family."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She has a rough history with Christine Quinn.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The history between the two realtors, who share an ex, is the most dramatic storyline of Season 4. The main misunderstanding between the two, regarding how soon Hernan got engaged to the ex after his Quinn's relationship, brings in tons of tension, with their co-workers choosing surprising sides of the tiff.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The drama with Quinn may have been a part of Hernan being cast on the show. Fellow cast member Fitzgerald told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a38136817/selling-sunset-season-4-secrets/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cosmopolitan UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cosmopolitan UK</a>, "I think the producers found out she had a history with Christine." Fitzgerald also hinted of the Season 4 drama as a whole, "Without giving too much away, I think people can be deceptive. So, in season 4 viewers are going to have to pay attention to what’s happening and put the pieces together, because there’s a lot of crocodile tears…"</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">She's ready to deal with the criticism.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hernan told People that she feels a bit nervous to deal with trolls after her reality TV debut. "I think it's really difficult in general for any person to kind of see negative criticism come at you. But of course, as a woman, even more so," she said. "I've seen a lot of the girls struggle with the feedback and criticism they've gotten."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that the Selling Sunset cast has already given her advice on dealing with the criticism, and says that she's "excited to open up [her] life."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"They've warned me, and they're super protective of me, which I love. They're like, 'Don't read the comments. They might not always be the best.' But, you know what? It's been really inspiring for me when I'm out and about with them and people will come up and say, 'You inspire me,' and things like that — that's why I want to do it. So that I can inspire young people the same way that a lot of my coworkers do as well," she said.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
