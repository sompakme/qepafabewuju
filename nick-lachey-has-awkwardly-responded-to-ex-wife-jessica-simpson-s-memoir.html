Dang," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>replied</a> to someone on Twitter.

But the gift sounds lovely!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As fate would have it, Nick Lachey happens to be giving interviews at the same time Jessica Simpson is promoting her new memoir, Open Book — leading to some awkward questions about his ex-wife's book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today Show</a> alongside wife Vanessa to promote their show Love is Blind, Lachey responded to revelations from Simpson's book, in which she says she was sexually abused as a young girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To be honest, I obviously haven't read the book, so I don't know what she said or what she revealed there," Lachey said when asked if he knew about the revelations while the two were married. "It was a long time ago, we've all moved on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lachey and Simpson were married from 2002 to 2006, and their relationship was famously immortalized in the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. Lachey married now-wife Vanessa in 2011, and Simpson married husband Eric Johnson in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps somewhat awkwardly, though, interviewer Hoda Kotb casually mentioned that Simpson told her the Lacheys sent her "something beautiful" after one of her kid’s births — which they promptly denied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel bad, I’m sorry," Vanessa Lachey said. “You said somebody sent her [something?]”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Kotb explained what Simpson had told her, Vanessa responded, “We — I …’cause now it’s like, did we? It wasn’t us, but thank you to whoever sent it from us! I don’t know her address. But thank you whoever sent it from us!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simpson also recently revealed she regrets not having signed a prenup before marrying Lachey, revealing in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Oz interview</a> that at the time, she was "offended" when Lachey asked her to sign one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wish I would've signed a prenup," she said. "No, and that's the funny thing, is that Nick wanted me to sign a prenup and I was so offended. I'm like, 'But we're going to be together for the rest of our lives. We're saying our vows to God and in front of all of our family and friends. This is never going to end,' and we didn't sign a prenup."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked what her relationship with her ex was now, Simpson replied, "There is not one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeenrCsecuamqGdqWK%2Fpr%2FPqKWdnZRit6a%2F0qKammWjnrqxv86nZKadnaS2sw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
