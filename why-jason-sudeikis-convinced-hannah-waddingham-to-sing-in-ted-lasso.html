If you’re a fan of Ted Lasso, then you know that Hannah Waddingham’s character Rebecca is the epitome of so many things. In addition to being the fearless manager of A.F.C. Richmond, Keeley’s ride-or-die best friend, and the number one fan of Ted’s iconic biscuits, she also a fantastic singer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When she asked them to guest star on the show, which also has special guests Leslie Odom Jr., Luke Evans, Sam Ryder, among others, all of them jumped at the opportunity. “They were all just like, ‘Absolutely!'” Waddingham remembered. “When are we doing it? What are you gonna ask me to dance? Are you gonna ask me to sing?” they then asked her. “Everyone was so keen outta the gate.” <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1406180683.jpg alt="Beautiful young woman playing with her hair in front of the bathroom mirror; good chemistry queen bee perfume" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">This $9 Perfume Gets a 'Million Compliments' & Reviewers Compare It to Beloved Marc Jacobs & Gucci Scents</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TCDTELA_G2145.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Among the special appearances from the Ted Lasso crew, for example, is Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso’s Nate), who’s seen dangling from the ceiling at a point in the show. “Well, we’ve got this idea that you would be trying to distract everyone so much that eventually we put a hook on your back and like have you like flying out into the fly floor,” Waddingham told Mohammed. “And he went, ‘Yeah, and I should stay there for the entire performance just with my legs dangling.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s just great,” Waddingham added.
