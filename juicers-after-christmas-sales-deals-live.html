2022-12-26T09:05:54.858Z Ninja JC101 Cold Press Pro | was $129.99, now $99.99 at Amazon
There's no way around it - this is the best budget slow press juicer on the market. It's the best priced juicer expert tester Millie has ever used, so while it can't quite match premium brands it comes in at hundreds of dollars cheaper."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's a great choice if you're working with a small kitchen but still want to make healthy juice, and comes at a much lower price than others on our list - now even cheaper at Amazon.</p>2022-12-26T10:09:45.989Z<p><strong>Do I need a blender or a juicer?<br></strong>It depends on what you're trying to achieve. For juice – thinner, more watery – you need a juicer. For shakes and smoothies - thicker, lumpier – you need a blender. It's really that simple. If you want both, your best bet is Breville's 3x Bluicer, which can perform both functions in one appliance. Our expert Head of Reviews Millie Fender scored it 100% when she put it to the test.&nbsp;</p>2022-12-26T10:41:07.646Z<p><strong>What's the difference between cold, slow, masticating and centrifugal juicers?</strong></p><p>Slow, cold press and masticating juicers are all the same thing. They use a crushing, squeezing auger slowly squeeze fruit and vegetables, separating the liquid from pulp.</p><p>Centrifugal juicers use spinning (hence centrifugal) blades to force fruits and vegetables up against a fine mesh, forcing liquid out of the solid body of the fruit.&nbsp;</p><p>Slow juicers tend to be more expensive than centrifugal juicers, because the slower method of juicing produces much less froth and pulp, creating a cleaner, smoother juice.&nbsp;</p>2022-12-26T11:15:39.911Z <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dbRBLsJQPszvtYdefSFJE-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>Do Nutribullet make the best juicers?<br></strong>This is something of a trick question. Nutribullet mostly make blenders. While we love them – we've dedicated a whole page to explaining <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/shopping/which-nutribullet-should-you-buy>which Nutribullet blender is best</a> – these blenders make smoothies and shakes rather than juice. If you're set on Nutribullet, though, we loved the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow>Nutribullet NBJ50200 Juicer Pro</a> on test, and you can grab it for $30 off at Amazon.</p>2022-12-26T12:07:07.364Z <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snc5H79oAyxEGTmqr86WYU-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>Breville Juice Fountain Elite Juicer, 800JEXL | </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow><strong>was $450</strong><strong>, now $299.99 at Amazon</strong></a><strong><br></strong>The Juice Fountain Elite is among Breville's best juicers. It has a handy three-inch feeding chute, and titanium reinforced blades that will cut through pretty much anything you throw at it, with dual-speed controls operating at 6,500 and 13,000RPM. You can now save $150 at Amazon.&nbsp;</p>2022-12-26T12:53:45.709Z <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ydoMJ4AQrurTmi2yrTN7rj-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>Omega VSJ843QS Juicer | </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow><strong>was $479.95</strong><strong>, now $443.27 at Amazon</strong></a><strong><br></strong>This masticating juicer is right at the top of our testing wish list.

It takes up hardly any space on the countertop and you can also use it to make nut milks and frozen treats. This deal will save you nearly $100 on the attractive rose gold colorway.&nbsp;</p>2022-12-26T14:14:30.221Z<p><strong>Are slow juicers healthier than centrifugal juicers?<br></strong>No. The claim used to be that slow juicers are healthier because their cooler running temperature retains more nutrients in the juice they produce. Because centrifugal juicers produce so much force, it used to be said that they create heat that destroys some of the nutrients in the juice.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it seems increasingly unlikely that a centrifugal juicer produces enough heat to cook and therefore destroy nutrients. The only difference health-wise is that slow juicers make nicer juice with less foam.&nbsp;</p>2022-12-26T15:02:46.851Z <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aHzAuePP4wLtmoNGKkkeLL-200-100.png200w><p><strong>Hurom HP Slow Juicer | </strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow><strong>was $379</strong><strong>, now $284.25 at Hurom</strong></a><strong><br></strong>This cold press juicer is ideal for serving up single cups.
