Kingston began his wrestling career in 2002 and has wrestled for multiple promotions across the globe. The Mad King was a mainstay on the independent scene for 18 years before signing with Tony Khan’s company in 2020. Now that he’s in AEW, that tendency to speak his mind has not changed at all.</p><p>Eddie Kingston, who is known for his bold comments and lone-wolf persona, isn’t too thrilled with Tony Khan’s way of booking talent on live television. The 41-year-old wrestler recently took to Twitter to express his dissatisfaction regarding a matter that has also been criticized by fans of late.</p><p>On the February 8th edition of&nbsp;AEW Dynamite, MJF was featured heavily on the show and Eddie Kingston took to&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;to express his displeasure with MJF’s overuse.</p><p>“Side note since we need to see his world champ 3 times within a hour and a half when it is a two hour show. F**k ortiz f**k house of black and f**k the roster. Born aline die alone I tried. I don’t need anyone including mox and penta. F**k everyone. Especially the “pillars “</p><p>As the reigning AEW World Champion, MJF does deserve to be at the center of attention, however, that doesn’t warrant the fact that the show should be built around him only. In recent weeks, fans have also questioned Tony Khan’s ways of featuring MJF so heavily on television, even at the cost of overshadowing other talents.</p><p>Eddie Kingston previously expressed negative opinions about MJF in an interview, calling him a “piece of sh*t” and saying he doesn’t know why The Salt Of The Earth is the AEW World Champion. He also noted that MJF acts the same way backstage as he does in character. The Mad King had also warned anyone who isn’t a good person to stay away from him.</p><p>At this point, it’s unknown whether Kingston’s comments are legitimate or kayfabe. His negative remarks about MJF could be the seeds for an upcoming title feud. It seems as if AEW is slowly building toward Kingston vs. MJF at some point this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on the story?
