However, Moore recently shuffled a few kind words Roddick's way as she reflected on their former bond amid a milestone career moment for the tennis pro. "Andy was a really formative part of my young adult life and although we're not in touch, I was so moved by this article reflecting on the 20th anniversary of his US Open win and the kind of life he's [led] since," wrote Moore on her Instagram story (via <a href=#>USA Today</a>). "I'm so happy for him and his family. Congrats on this milestone, Andy!"</p><p>Moore also commented on <a href=#>Roddick's wife, Brooklyn Decker's</a> <a href=#>Instagram</a> account where she'd promoted the GQ article honoring him. "I loved this article. Congrats on the 20th Anniversary of the Open!" wrote Moore. Roddick doesn't have a personal Instagram, but he is active on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. So far, Roddick himself hasn't returned Moore's sentiment, though most people appreciate fond acknowledgment. Roddick also did not mention Moore in his feature for GQ, but it probably has more to do with his general lack of fixation on the past&nbsp; —&nbsp;even his accomplishments&nbsp;— which is a recurring theme within his interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZn16gY6wn56qlWK6orrDsmSmp5%2Bnsm6%2F05qlnatdmsVurs6ynauhlaOxbq3NnbBmqp%2BZsaqvymarqJyRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
