She then asks a co-star to take her mic off, and gets into her car while listening to the phone.</p><p>She then leaves the trip after claiming her husband was in the hospital with internal bleeding. Just minutes later, the police turn up, after the RHOSLC cast members discuss whether to wait for Jen, or to leave for the trip.</p><p>The police ask them if Jen is alright, and announce that they need to speak with her. They also question which vehicle she left the area in.</p><p>It looks like the entire phone call scenario and hospital situation was a complete lie, as many have uncovered she was really running from police. Homeland Security officers turned up in the last few minutes of the RHOSLC episode to take Jen Shah into custody.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So excited to watch Jen's arrest in the last 20 seconds of today's episode ü§© <a href=#>#RHOSLC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6cC5jF9kaC</a></p>‚Äî Alex by Alene Too (@nuevousername) <a href=#>November 7, 2021</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-rhoslc-stars-legal-troubles>The RHOSLC star‚Äôs legal troubles</h2><p>Jen Shah is part of an ongoing wire fraud scandal.
