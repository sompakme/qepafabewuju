Newer cars with electronic ignition and fuel injection systems are scheduled to go from 25,000 miles to as many as 100,000 miles without needing a major tune-up.<h2>Why does my car jerk when I accelerate?</h2>Worn-out spark plugs or the electrical cables attached to them are one of the most common causes of cars stuttering. A deficient spark plug causes the engine to misfire, making your car jerk when you accelerate.<h2>What does a tune-up consist of and cost?</h2>Spark plugs and wires can be replaced for $40-$150 or more for a basic tune-up, but a standard tune-up can cost $200-$800 or more.

Sometimes the light may come on after fueling if the gas cap is a little loose. Or it could mean your catalytic converter needs to be inspected.<h2>How many miles can you drive with check engine light on?</h2>If your Check Engine light comes on for any reason, it's still possible to drive your vehicle, but it is only recommended to drive another 50 to 100 miles before scanning your car's computer for error codes.
