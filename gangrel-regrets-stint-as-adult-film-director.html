He’s seen a lot of people get a blood bath before, but he also contributed to a much different form of entertainment as a porn director.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc</a>, Gangrel admitted that he regrets his brief stint as a porn director. He only shot one scene for “Miami Rump Shakerz 2,” but he now calls it a “stupid decision.”</p><p>“I put a pinky toe in and jumped out real quick because it got me so much heat and negativity that I backed out.”</p><p>“I directed one scene but it was a stupid decision. Sometimes with porn, everybody secretly kind of likes it but they publicly shame it. It backfired so I’m gonna stick with what I know in pro wrestling. I might be only somewhere in the middle with wrestling, but at least I know it and love it and can commit to it 100 percent.”<br></p><p>In 2007, the “New Porn Order” company announced that Gangrel would direct twelve films for them. Apparently, it only got as far as one scene. Their official press release about Gangrel’s directorial debut said:</p><p>The New Porn Order Signs Former WWE Star The New Porn Order has signed Former WWE wrestler Gangrel to a 12 movie exclusive directing deal. Gangrel, now officially known as The Vampire Warrior, will make his directorial debut with “Miami Rump Shakerz 2” set to be released in November. In addition to directing, he will also be making appearances as part of the NPO team.</p><p>“I am thrilled to be joining the New Porn Order and taking this step into a new level of my career. Directing offers a new challenge that I am very excited to be taking on. I look forward to the many great films that will come from this union.” said The Vampire Warrior.</p><p>The Vampire Warrior Gangrel began his career in Florida, wrestling for various independent companies. In 1995 he went on to be a part of the ECW for a short period where he was noticed by the WWE. He signed a contract with the WWE and made his TV debut on Sunday Night Heat in August 1998. He was released from the WWF in 2001 and joined the NWA in 2002.</p><p>The years since then have seen The Vampire Warrior bouncing back and forth between the WWE and the independent circuit. In January 2007 he was officially released from the WWE and is now looking forward to his directing debut with the NPO. “We are very happy to have The Vampire Warrior Gangrel as part of the NPO team.</p><p>“We are confident that he will add a certain edge and uniqueness to films, and will quickly rise to the top of the most sought after directors” said Craig Valentine of the NPO. ‘The Vampire Warrior Gangrel’ will make his debut appearance as part of the NPO at the AEE/AVN Awards Show in Las Vegas, January 2008.”</p><p>Years later, Gangrel regrets this decision. It might have sounded like a good idea at the time, but the Vampire Warrior obviously decided to stick to wrestling.</p><p>October 26, 2019 12:32 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e5BpZmtuX5yur7PRnqNmqpWcv6bA0maqraGeqXqiv4yam66kpGKzqrjMZpuiqpWYwbC%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
