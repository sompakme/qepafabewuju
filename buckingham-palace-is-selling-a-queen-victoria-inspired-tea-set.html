Her Majesty's butler, Grant Harold, previously revealed the monarch's favourite tea and how she takes it. Speaking about British etiquette in BBC Three comedy show Miss Holland, he explained: "I am sure the Queen enjoys her Assam or her Earl Grey the traditional way, made with tea leaves in a teapot and poured into a fine bone china teacup. She will also use a strainer. It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once."</p><p id=eDX81Av3PPE33 data-wc=58>The butler also revealed the steps to prepare a royal cup of tea; pour the tea into the cup from a teapot, add milk to the cup after the tea and never before, stir back and forth (never use a circular motion and never touch the sides). Lastly, you should always sip from the cup and never slurp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmMKqv8innGhqYGd9cX6Pb29ta2RofKPBwqSgp5%2BYlrpuvMClmJydXabCprHNZq2im6Skv6qtjK2cmmWjmsFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
