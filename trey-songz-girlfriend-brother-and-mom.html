She is of Ethiopian descent and is also known for her work with Chris Brown, Omarion, Kanye West and, of course, Trey Songz.&nbsp;Apparently they were the real deal and have the matching tattoos to prove it.</span></p><p><span>To this day, Trey says she’s one of only two women he’s loved…romantically of course.</span></p><p><strong><span>Trey Songz Girlfriend;&nbsp;Necole Bitchie & Drew Sidora</span></strong></p><p><span>The two briefly dated in 2009, after his breakup with Helen.&nbsp;First there was the speculation about the couple, after all the ‘harmless’ flirting that was going on between them.&nbsp;Soon after there was evidence, a photo of them closing at sandrarose.com.</span></p><p><span>This must be one of his many hookups, as around the same time he was reportedly involved with actress/singer, Drew Sidora.</span></p><p><strong><span>Trey Songz Girlfriend;&nbsp;Lauren London</span></strong></p><p><span>Now this one most of you already know but for those of you who don’t it’s one of only two women the singer is in love with but these two have a kind of of “he said she said”.&nbsp;The “he” being Trey and Lauren being the “she”.</span></p><p><span>In an interview with&nbsp;</span><strong><span>The Q Side</span></strong><span>, when asked about her and the singer, she replied, “I feel like there’s always a rumor that I’m dating someone that I’ve never met before. People have their judgments and ideas about who I am and they don’t know anything. We’re not together. We just took a picture together. I know him and he’s a great guy. , so I don’t care about that.”</span></p><p><span>Trey had something completely different to say about them when he told&nbsp;</span><strong><span>106 KMEL</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Lauren London is a very important person to me, I love her to death.&nbsp;Is it my wife?&nbsp;No, we’re great friends and we’ve been lovers before.&nbsp;“It’s a very interesting story.</span></p><p><strong><span>Trey Songz Girlfriend;&nbsp;Cheating</span></strong></p><p><span>Trey must really take his man’s candy status very seriously, as he was reportedly involved with various women between 2009 and 2013 when he was still ‘alleged’ with Lauren London.</span></p><p><span>Rumor has it that he was with Keri Hilson, TahiryJose, Ciara and Simply Jess, while remaining in a relationship with Lauren, maybe that’s one of the reasons why she won’t acknowledge their relationship, who knows?</span></p><p><strong><span>Trey Songz Girlfriend;&nbsp;Tanaya Henry</span></strong></p><p><span>These two had an on and off thing going for 7 good years, with the two finally announcing the time of their relationship’s death in 2015. It was actually quite serious, as a few months before their split, Trey announced to Wendy Williams that he wanted to start a family with Henry.&nbsp;Well, that plan obviously went down the drain.</span></p><p><span>It seems that in the end, his infidelity was decisive.</span></p><p><strong><span>Trey Songz Girlfriend;&nbsp;Khloe Kardashian</span></strong></p><p><span>In July 2016, Khloe and Trey were spotted together in a very compromising situation.&nbsp;Trey was performing at Drai’s Nightclub in Las Vegas and, according to E!&nbsp;News, shortly after the concert ended, a source revealed to E!&nbsp;News that the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</span></strong><span>&nbsp;star and singer later reunited and “were seen partying” at Drai’s house after the night.</span></p><p><span>Also, she was all over her social media.&nbsp;What’s unclear is whether the two are still an item or if Trey is going to remain a “playa for life.”</span></p><p><span>See also: Usher’s love life;&nbsp;Is he single or married with children</span></p><h2><span>Trey Songz Brother</span></h2><p><span>Trey has two brothers, Alex and Forrest Neverson, but we’re pretty sure the brother to talk about today is Forrest.&nbsp;Like his brother, he looks good and has a body for days.&nbsp;Turns out Trey isn’t the only sibling who wants to be in the spotlight.</span></p><p><span>In a bid to earn his own star status, he posted some racy photos, not once but twice and the second time there was actually a video to go along with it.&nbsp;The general public can agree on this, however, he would certainly succeed in the adult film industry.</span></p><h2><span>Trey Songz Mom</span></h2><p><span>She’s known to be one of the hottest women out there, and she’s avid proof that “black doesn’t crack.”&nbsp;April Tucker is an inspirational woman as she had Trey when she was 17 and not only kept him, she used the fame she has as a platform to reach out to other teen moms.</span></p><p><span>The star obviously shares a special bond with her mother.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGisoprGbr%2FOp56zZZeev62y0aKcp5xdl7%2BwwMeeqWaZnpl6rrvMaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
