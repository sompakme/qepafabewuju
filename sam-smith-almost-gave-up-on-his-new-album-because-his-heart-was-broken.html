Writing music about that kind of thing is normally like therapy for me, but when I got dumped this time round I just couldn't write for about two months...”</p><p>“My team had to force me to get into the studio, because I almost felt as if I didn't want to do it any more. So, there were moments on there where it got a bit intense and I started to lose myself.”</p><p>Sam also admitted his friendly rivalry with friend Ed Sheeran helped get his thoughts back on making music:</p><p>“It makes you push yourself. Watching him (Sheeran) this past year has just been incredible, but yeah, of course it makes me hungry.”</p><p>Sir Elton John suggested Sam and Ed’s friendship is comparable to his relationship with Rod Stewart:</p><p>“Rod and I were competitive with each other, and that's healthy because it drives you, but we loved and supported each other, too. I think perhaps you and Ed Sheeran are the same way. You do both love each other, both admire each other and are going through the same thing as each other, at the same age... You're the new Rod and me!”</p><a href=# onclick='gusto.tracking.social("facebook","share")'><img alt="Facebook share" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.smoothradio.com/assets_v4r/gusto/img/facebook-share.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> <a href=# onclick='gusto.tracking.social("twitter","share")'><img alt="X share" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.smoothradio.com/assets_v4r/gusto/img/x-share.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaKaVrMBwv8CmZKylmam1brrEmqmlsV2crrexjK6nZqSRqbK0wIyao5utnWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
