I’ve spent some of my childhood in Boston, some of my childhood in Spain. My family, my brother, my parents, my nephew, everyone is over there in Spain now. I’m here. There was a lot of back and forth my entire life.”</p><p>However, on Baldwin’s biography page on her agency’s speakers website it states that she “was born in Mallorca, Spain and raised in Boston, Massachusetts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/ad0572fd-16da-4d69-aa96-7eb63189e510.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/0bf09310-9673-4bc2-a83f-42423354a5e8.jpg><p>And in a 2016 interview with Hola! magazine it also stated: “Hilaria, who was born in Spain, has made certain to raise her children with her native language, Spanish.”&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter jumped on the furore and began sharing clips of Hilaria, including one TV appearance where she spoke with a pronounced Spanish accent.&nbsp;</p><p>During a cooking segment,&nbsp; she even seemingly forgot the English word for “cucumber.”</p><p>Hilaria’s husband Alec also took to Instagram to rubbish the Twitter user who questioned his wife’s claim of Spanish heritage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000627701718-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000627701721.jpg><p>During his rant, he said: “Just a lot of s**t.</p><p>“You have to kind of hack your way through the debris of Twitter.
