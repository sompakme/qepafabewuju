"He was like, 'Anything you ever need,' and I just said, then and there, 'I'm coming to Detroit,' so [let's do that]."&nbsp;Of course, Sheeran graciously offered him an escape hatch just in case he changed his mind. "I gave him the out," he said. "Whenever I perform with people, I always say, 'You can cancel last minute if you want,' so there's never any pressure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tjaYJwvsSao2aqlZbAsLrSZpuopqRitaat0WacpqGemrpurc2ypKiqlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
