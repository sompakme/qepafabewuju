In the 19-page document, the women accuse the body positive creative of "either cherry-pick[ing] allegations or outright [omitting those] inconvenient to their position, instead sanitizing them with euphemisms."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lizzo-s-accusers-fight-back-against-potential-dismissal>Lizzo's Accusers Fight Back Against Potential Dismissal</h2></span><p>Lizzo attends the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center on January 26, 2020 in Los Angeles, CA.

"Last month, 18 independent witnesses stood by Lizzo’s work ethic and character," Stefan Friedman told the outlet. "It is clear that since then, these plaintiff lawyers have come up with exactly zero to refute these facts." For their part, the defence suggests that Davis, Williams, and Rodriquez were exhibiting "a pattern of gross misconduct and failure to perform their job up to par" before cutting ties with Lizzo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another starlet who's all too familiar with the intensity of being in the spotlight while going through a personal crisis shared her thoughts on Lizzo's situation just last month. "People are more interested in believing the negative," Keke Palmer reflected while discussing the "Truth Hurts" hitmaker's hateful backlash over her dancer's allegations of harassment.
