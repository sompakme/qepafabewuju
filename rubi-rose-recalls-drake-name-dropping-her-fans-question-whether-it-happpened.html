"It's two different ones because some people say he wasn't talking about me. But, he was clearly talking about me. When Drake was saying 'the Rubi Rose two-tone.' That one because it's f*cking Drake." When Complex shared the interview on Instagram, fans shared several laughs at Rose's expense. "Smh pretty girls never beating them stupid allegations," one fan joked. Another added: "Not her celebrating like she just won the lottery or something."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rubi-rose-attends-hawks-wizards-game>Rubi Rose Attends Hawks-Wizards Game</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - NOVEMBER 01: Rapper Rubi Rose attends the game between the Atlanta Hawks and the Washington Wizards at State Farm Arena on November 01, 2023, in Atlanta, Georgia.

"Rob49 saying 'I ain't gonna lie, I had a lotta hoes, but I want a Rubi Rose.' It's cute. It's funny. I'm flattered. Typically, people will text me and be like, 'Yo, so-and-so said your name.'" She added that she hadn't heard the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a> leak where the rapper mentions her.
