Hemsworth is currently filming Killerman on none other than Tybee Island, an island off the coast of Savannah, Georgia, where the two met and fell in love in 2010 on the set of The Last Song. And recently Cyrus showed up on set, prompting fans to speculate that the pair would re-create their iconic kiss scene (which was also their <a href=#>first ever kiss</a>). While we've yet to see that happen, the two have been showing a lot of love on the beach.</p><p>On Saturday Cyrus and Hemsworth were spotted jet-skiing and taking adorable pictures together, InStyle <a href=#>reports</a>, noting they were wearing some accessories on those fingers. Cyrus paired the engagement ring that Hemsworth first gave to her in 2012 (which she began wearing again after the couple reconnected in 2016) with a sparkling band, which could be a wedding band. Hemsworth was also spotted wearing a silver band on his left finger.</p><p>Take a look:</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span><p><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd hBJEBy fNaHcW caption__credit">Backgrid</span></p></figure><p>Wearing matching rings in the place that they first met? Coincidence or wedding bells? It's hard to say, but this isn't even the first time fans were convinced the two tied the knot.</p><p>In March Billy Ray Cyrus sent the Internet into a frenzy when he <a href=#>posted</a> a picture of a blissful-looking Cyrus wearing a white dress with the caption, "I'm so happy…you are happy." Since then, everyone including Billy Ray, <a href=#>Mama Tish</a>, <a href=#>Noah Cyrus</a>, and even Cyrus herself have stated in multiple interviews that the two are just happy living their lives in Malibu as an engaged couple. Just last month Cyrus <a href=#>said</a>, “I don’t envision marriage. I’m 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do.” Despite all the talk, this isn't the first time that Hemsworth wore a band on his left ring finger; the actor was seen wearing a similar-looking one in August.</p><p>Whether the rings are, in fact, wedding bands or just new bling, it seems like Cyrus and Hemsworth are happy now that they are back together. And the rest of us can just rewatch The Last Song to our hearts content.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Walked the Red Carpet Together for the First Time in Years</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FforatsdhmmrKqpah6rbXApmShnZ2oxLC%2B06FksJ2Rp3qurdOcn6Kml2K%2FqrrGrGSopl2rrqSt06Kmpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
