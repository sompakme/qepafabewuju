The country singer, known for writing songs about her troubled past relationships, hasn’t tried to hide the fact that the sweeping romantic ballad “Enchanted” on her last album Speak Now describes her unrealized crush on Owl City’s Adam Young.
“It was about this guy that I met in New York City, and I had talked to him on email or something before, but I had never met him,” she told Yahoo!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To clear any lingering doubt about the mystery man’s&nbsp;identity, she capitalized the letters A-D-A-M in the album’s lyric&nbsp;booklet.</p><p class=p2>On Saturday, Young finally responded to Swift’s public serenade. Addressing the singer on Owl City’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>website</a>&nbsp;, Young confessed that he too felt sparks fly when they first met.</p><p class=p2>“I’ll be the first to admit I’m a rather shy boy and since music is the&nbsp;most eloquent form of communication I can muster, I decided to record&nbsp;something for you–a sort of a ‘reply’ to the breathtaking song on your&nbsp;current record,” he wrote. “You are a true princess from a dreamy fairy&nbsp;tale, and above all, I just want you to know…I was enchanted to meet&nbsp;you too.”</p><p class=p2>His recording of “Enchanted” carries Owl City’s jazzy, fanciful&nbsp;signature and includes a few lyric tweaks, as well as a new verse at the&nbsp;end: “I was never in love with someone else / I never had somebody&nbsp;waiting on me / ‘Cause you were all of my dreams come true / And I just&nbsp;wish you knew / Taylor I was so in love with you.”</p><p class=p2>The verse is a direct response to Swift’s original lyrics, “Please&nbsp;don’t be in love with someone else / Please don’t have somebody waiting&nbsp;on you.”</p><p class=p2>Watch the video below to hear Young’s response to Swift.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKKwwKZksqelo7RuvsSsp6imlKh6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjHJwa2plZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
