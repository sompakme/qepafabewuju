Produced using an official portrait of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, taken ten years previously for the Silver Jubilee and showing her wearing the Vladimir Tiara, the print has extra sparkle in the form of “diamond dust” – fine particles of crushed glass applied to the portrait when wet to add texture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b61bfbc83a22-2507013b.jpg><p id=eDOV-XxOT5 data-wc=79>While the exhibition portrays the intimacy and relatability of the royal family as much as their grandeur, a standout image shows a glamorous Elizabeth II a mere 20 days after she became Queen in 1952, posing in a demure black taffeta dress. Taken by society photographer Dorothy Wilding and commissioned by the Post Office and the Royal Mint, the image from Elizabeth’s first official portrait sitting as monarch was intended to be used on bank notes, coins and stamps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d0fb1543b68-2416689.jpg><p id=ecOgbqjv7n data-wc=31>However, when the pose and jewellery were deemed unsuitable, another sitting was held a few weeks later and the resulting portraits, with Her Majesty wearing a lighter-hued dress, were used instead.&nbsp;</p><p id=evkpsUXygn data-wc=41>Another never-before-seen masterpiece going on display is that of Elizabeth and her husband, the former Duke of Edinburgh, captured by Antony on the balcony overlooking the inner quadrangle of Buckingham Palace on 28 October 1958 – the State Opening of Parliament.</p><p id=eHVKRd7_tk data-wc=59>Visitors will also get a glimpse of the work behind the images: handwritten notes reveal some of the discussions that took place between the photographer and staff over how they were used, with phrases including: “Please do not cut,” and: “Rough Guide – I don’t think it would be very good postcard size as they would be so small.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/106808b8da78-2154096.jpg><p id=eoDHe1jCXd data-wc=29>Another highlight is a stunning portrait of the then Princess Elizabeth’s younger sister, Princess Margaret, posing in a tulle ballgown adorned with sequin butterflies to commemorate her 19th birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b2911b92c79-2315322.jpg><h2>Revealing images</h2><p id=eTbvGCXsBp data-wc=58>But an intimate photograph taken by Lord Snowdon 18 years later shows a far more stripped-back version of the royal. “Princess Margaret is shown here as a glamorous, sophisticated woman- of great beauty,” says Alessandro. “At this point in time, Princess Margaret and Snowdon are in their seventh year of marriage and parents to their two young children.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekIPnzyNHp data-wc=27>“The photographs of Princess Margaret are charged by a certain aura and their personal connection contributes to the intimacy of this enduringly appealing and strikingly modern image.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6fbbb053e24c-2335975.jpg><p id=erWuVg4z9g data-wc=56>“The pose is reminiscent of a portrait taken during their first sitting in 1959, which created a great sensation when published as the Princess’s 29th birthday portrait as none of the strapless dress she was wearing was visible in the final photograph. I wonder whether they smiled at that thought while working on this portrait together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/acc97b2b071e-2851009.jpg><p id=e3xbmb8n5a data-wc=116>Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother also stars in a series of portrait proofs taken in 1939, when she was the Queen Consort. The proofs, most of which have not been released before now, marked Cecil Beaton’s first commission from a senior member of the royal family. A session that was supposed to last for only 20 minutes turned into more than five hours, heralding the start of a decades-spanning relationship. Testament to that bond, the Queen Mother once thanked Sir Cecil while inadvertently summing up the unique magic of royal portrait photography, saying: “I feel that, as a family, we must be deeply grateful to you for producing us, as really quite nice and real people.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/407249d70730-2315116.jpg><p id=ev9KsgdGXO data-wc=26><strong>Royal Portraits: A Century of Photography starts in The King's Gallery, Buckingham Palace on 17 May.
