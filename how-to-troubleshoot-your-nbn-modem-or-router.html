When either stops working, it is bound to be noticed and outrys come from all areas of the home.</p><p>While you could quickly call the neighbour to see if their internet is working, or call your internet service provider, there are steps you can take first.</p><p><span class=h2><b>How do you tell if your modem or router is not working?</b></span></p><p>Understanding where the issue lies is critical in troubleshooting your internet outage. Firstly, check if the internet is failing on more than one device to eliminate whether it is a computer or smartphone issue.</p><p>You then need to understand whether the issue is with your Wi-Fi or with the internet link to your home. The Wi-Fi is coming from a device in your home, while the internet service is provided by your provider. To check this, assess whether your devices are still connected to Wi-Fi but unable to browse the web.</p><p>If the Wi-Fi is not connecting, this suggests the problem is with your home network. This might be resolved by power cycling (turning it off and on again) your home router or connecting to the router with a cable.</p><p>However, if the Wi-Fi is connected but you’re still offline, you can begin to troubleshoot your internet service.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Could you save on your internet plan?</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>What lights should be on my NBN modem?</b></span></p><p>The NBN modem is your box to the world wide web. While they typically connect to a router to distribute your internet service, the modem is responsible for your internet connection. On most NBN modems you will have a series of lights which require your attention and signal if your connection is in check.</p><p>Firstly, the Power indicator should be consistently lit and solid. Secondly, the WAN or DSL indicator light should be on and thirdly, the internet light should be on and flashing.</p><p>Always ensure that the cabling is intact and in good condition should any of these indicators be yellow, red or off entirely.</p><p>If any of these indicator lights are not as described then this is incredibly valuable information when you do contact your internet service provider for support.</p><p><span class=h2><b>How do I troubleshoot my NBN modem?</b></span></p><p>Knowing whether there is an <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=d2cec048d0140856d280ae58701b8c89 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>outage</a> in the area can be as simple as sending a text to your neighbour. But it’s a good idea to first power cycle your modem and router when an outage is experienced because it could automatically re-synchronise the connection and have you browsing again.</p><p>During a support call with your internet provider, be sure to outline the troubleshooting steps you have taken so far to save you both some time.</p><p>If you’ve indicated that the WAN light on the modem is no longer lit then the support team can immediately check your line to see where the fault is occurring. If a fault has occurred on the line itself then an NBN technician may be required and your internet provider will handle the escalation.</p><p>In most cases the service is restored remotely and an NBN technician is not required to visit your home. In some situations, however, the connection to the home may need to be looked at and this will be co-ordinated with your internet provider. This includes modem replacements, which can be required in some instances.</p><p><span class=h2><b>Is the problem your internet provider? Compare and switch</b></span></p><p>While we often don’t interact with our internet provider unless there is a problem, it is in that moment where they need to shine. If you feel as though you are not being treated like a VIP then there are plenty of providers out there ready to roll out the red carpet.</p><p>Providers of the NBN are plentiful and competition is rife. Changing to a new provider can take minutes and generally does not require any hardware changes.</p><p>NBN plans are available without a contract, so switching providers may mean no termination fees either, though it’s best to double check this.</p><p>When it comes to support for your NBN, you will find some companies who offer a virtual agent to chat with while some are offering Australian support centres without a need to hold for hours.</p><p>Compare them regularly and change whenever necessary, as there could well be a cost benefit too.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Find a better suited internet plan</a></b></i></p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=7de5abf3475cfa94ebb2fdef89fbf2bd data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Have you reviewed your internet plan lately? 3 simple steps to save</a></b></p><p>Originally published as <a class=body-link href=#>How to troubleshoot your NBN modem or router</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7wqGcnKOfqsFwuMifnGiln6OyunvBnqqtZZ6Xu265zp2cpmWipMK1sdFmq6unpZe5pr%2FHqKatoZ6cfK%2Bx1qxkrKyfp8ZwgMJrb29tY2iwdITCcpxtcWGWhaavj51scXCRZ4Kif8E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
