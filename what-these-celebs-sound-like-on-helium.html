The guest, former Miss USA Kára McCullough, shared some of her scientific knowledge, and like all good teachers, she included a tutorial so the audience could see the lesson in practice. McCullough brought two different sets of balloons, each with different gases inside, to demonstrate how sound moves through them.</p><p dir=ltr>"We know that helium is actually six times lighter than the air that we breathe," McCoullough <a href=#>began</a>. "That is why it's able to float in the air." After giving Harvey an overview of the steps he was to take, the two inhaled the gas, both speaking in noticeably different voices. McCullough took the experiment further by having Harvey inhale sulfur hexafluoride, a gas that's six times heavier than the air we breathe, which gave Harvey a noticeably and comically lower speaking voice.</p><p dir=ltr>Before and during his career, Harvey used his voice to make lots of fans. As he <a href=#>said</a> to a contestant in an episode of "Family Feud," "Back in the day, Ms. Elaine, when I was a player, they used to call me butterscotch because my conversation was that of butterscotch." "You know, Steve, I'm 78, but I'm not dead. Keep talking," the contestant encouraged Harvey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlnZ4J3fo6wn5qsXam1pr%2FEZpqepJWXwG6%2Fzq6lnWWcnrimec6nZKGdnJ7Crns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
