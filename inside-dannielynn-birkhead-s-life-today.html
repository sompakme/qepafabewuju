That was something dad Larry Birkhead was aware of and wanted to change. Dannielynn, along with Birkhead, will aim to rediscover Smith in a new TV special for&nbsp;20/20, which sees the former visit "the most influential places in Anna Nicole's life for the first time," according to a press release obtained by&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>In the trailer for the February 2021 special, Dannielynn is smiling and enjoying the process of rediscovering her mother. She is also seen sitting in the passenger seat of a car alongside Birkhead as they are driving to Mexia, Texas, where Smith grew up. "Dannielynn's a teenager now, and she doesn't know a ton of things about her mom," Birkhead narrates in the&nbsp;<a href=#>trailer</a>. "As a dad who has a child whose mom passed away, I thought, 'Why not go back to Anna's beginnings?" Besides talking to Smith's friends from high school, Dannielynn and Birkhead will "see the places she frequented before becoming famous," and revisit "some of Anna Nicole's memorabilia from her life and career, tucked away in a storage locker following her death," according to&nbsp;People.</p><p>Judging from the trailer, it seems like Dannielynn won't be the only one learning new information about her mother, as audiences will get to see her life in a new light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpnaoB2e8inqqKclWKxorrNopylsZ6jeqO10aSfnpmUqHqttcWeZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
