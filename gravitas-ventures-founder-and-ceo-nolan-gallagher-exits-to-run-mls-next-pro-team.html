In 2019, Gallagher and Gravitas co-owners Michael Murphy and Brendan Gallagher moved the company to the Ohio city in a bid to “further economic momentum for media and entertainment in their hometown,” per the company. The soccer team is the latest push to continue those efforts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a statement about his exit, Gallagher explained that the “time is right” to focus on his next chapter, one that includes this men’s team as well as (“hopefully soon”) a professional women’s soccer team.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I, and by extension Gravitas, have been so fortunate to have collaborated with so many talented directors, producers, actors and media executive over the last 17 years. To have had a front row seat and active hand in the birth, growth and maturation of how audiences enjoy compelling stories on video on demand has been personally and professionally rewarding,” Gallagher said. “I am thankful to the entire Gravitas team past and especially present and wish them and Len Asper and Anthem Sports and Entertainment continued success in the years to come.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Asper, in return, thanked Gallagher for his leadership as he sets off on “his next entrepreneurial journey” in his hometown of Cleveland. “In the last year, Nolan has worked closely with the Anthem executive team to hire and promote from within the next chapter of Gravitas’ leadership and to help ensure Gravitas’s filmmakers, producers and stakeholders continue to receive world class service. We are working with Nolan and have retained an advisor to identify a successor to lead the excellent senior team at Gravitas and expect to make a decision within the coming months.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Under Nolan’s leadership, Gravitas built up a theatrical and Video on Demand distribution business with a catalog that now numbers upwards of 3,000 films. Recent releases include the wide theatrical play for the <a href=# id=auto-tag_diane-keaton_1 data-tag=diane-keaton>Diane Keaton</a>-starrer Mack & Rita, which came out Aug. 12 under the newly-launched Gravitas Premiere label, as well as The King’s Daughter&nbsp;directed by Sean McNamara,&nbsp;Queen Bees&nbsp;from director Michael Lembeck, and&nbsp;Our Friend&nbsp;from helmer by&nbsp;Gabriela Cowperthwaite and starring <a href=# id=auto-tag_casey-affleck_1 data-tag=casey-affleck>Casey Affleck</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_dakota-johnson_1 data-tag=dakota-johnson>Dakota Johnson</a> and Jason Segel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKi%2BwK%2BgrZmjYsOmutOuqZ6rXZiysHnNqKOapl2crq24wKCfnqpdmsWqwIxqaWxtY2eFcoCPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
