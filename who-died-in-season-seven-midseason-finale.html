The Walking Dead wrapped the first half of its seventh season Sunday with a violent midseason finale that helped set the stage for one of the biggest battles featured in Robert Kirkman’s comic book series on which the AMC drama is based.
The extended episode featured the deaths of two key members of Rick’s (Andrew Lincoln) community at the Alexandria Safe Zone: series regular Austin Nichols’ defiant Spencer Monroe and recurring player Olivia (Ann Mahoney), the latter of whom oversaw the armory."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Spencer, who was the last surviving member of the Monroe family who founded and built Alexandria, attempted to sway&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=4>Negan</span>&nbsp;into putting him in charge over Rick. After first appearing to entertain the thought,&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=5>Negan</span>&nbsp;winds up proving to the entire community what he thinks of traitors like Spencer by stabbing and slashing his stomach open. Spencer’s death offered many&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Alexandrians data-scaytid=10>Alexandrians</span>&nbsp;their first look at the charismatic psychopath and helping to unite the community against&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=6>Negan</span>.</p><p>Spencer’s death triggered&nbsp;<a href=#>Rosita</a> (Christian <span data-scayt_word=Serratos data-scaytid=12>Serratos</span>), who attempted to strike back when she used the lone bullet Eugene (Josh <span data-scayt_word=McDermitt data-scaytid=74>McDermitt</span>) made for her to take aim at <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=11>Negan</span>. Instead, she winds up hitting his <a href=#>beloved</a> bat, Lucille. To pay for her outburst, <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=14>Negan</span> has one of his Saviors kill Olivia, who goes out when she is shot in the face. (Her death plays out much later and very differently in <span data-scayt_word="Kirkman's" data-scaytid=16>Kirkman’s</span> comic series.) After Eugene confesses to making the bullet, <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=15>Negan</span> takes him back to the Sanctuary.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>At the Sanctuary, meanwhile, <a href=#>Daryl</a> (Norman <span data-scayt_word=Reedus data-scaytid=21>Reedus</span>) finally escapes <span data-scayt_word="Negan's" data-scaytid=22>Negan’s</span> compound and heads back to the <a href=#>Hilltop</a> with Jesus (Tom Payne). There, Daryl reunites with Maggie (Lauren <span data-scayt_word=Cohan data-scaytid=23>Cohan</span>) and Sasha (<span data-scayt_word=Sonequa data-scaytid=24>Sonequa</span> Martin-Green) for the first time since Glenn (Steven <span data-scayt_word=Yeun data-scaytid=25>Yeun</span>) and Abraham’s (Michael <span data-scayt_word=Cudlitz data-scaytid=26>Cudlitz</span>) deaths.</p><p>The episode ends with Rick, together with <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=29>Michonne</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Danai data-scaytid=30>Danai</span> <span data-scayt_word=Gurira data-scaytid=31>Gurira</span>) and a few other key&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Alexandrians data-scaytid=27>Alexandrians</span>, traveling to the Hilltop and reuniting with Maggie, Sasha, Daryl and company. There, Rick admits that Maggie was right — they all have to unite to fight <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=28>Negan</span> and break free from the ruthless leader’s dictatorship.&nbsp;</p><p>The episode sets the stage for the second half of the AMC zombie drama’s seventh season to focus on uniting the Hilltop community — including its cowardly leader Gregory (<span data-scayt_word=Xander data-scaytid=34>Xander</span> Berkeley) — with Alexandria as well as <a href=#>King Ezekiel’s (<span data-scayt_word=Khary data-scaytid=35>Khary</span> Payton) Kingdom</a>, where Morgan (<span data-scayt_word=Lennie data-scaytid=36>Lennie</span> James) and, to a lesser extent, Carol (Melissa McBride) reside. (Carol and Morgan were also encouraged during the 90-minute episode to help convince Ezekiel to attack the Saviors first.)</p><p>Given Tara’s (<span data-scayt_word=Alanna data-scaytid=37>Alanna</span> Masterson) <a href=#>knowledge of the <span data-scayt_word=Oceansiders data-scaytid=38>Oceansiders</span></a>‘ heavily armed community, the stage is set for the comic book run known as <a href=# rel=nofollow>All Out War</a>, in which all of the communities — Alexandria, the Kingdom and the Hilltop — unite to attack <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=39>Negan</span> and his Sanctuary. Given that Morgan has indicated his <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=40>Negan</span> will be around for season eight, it’s unclear if that battle will happen in the back half of season eight or if the remainder of Walking Dead‘s seventh cycle will focus more on reuniting the three communities. Sunday’s <span data-scayt_word=midseason data-scaytid=43>midseason</span> finale also may have included a nod to the result of the All Out War arc. The scene in which Rick and <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=44>Michonne</span> (finally) agree that they need to fight <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=45>Negan</span> took place in the cell that Morgan built last season at Alexandria. In the comics, rather than kill <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=46>Negan</span>, Rick ultimately locks him up and keeps him in — yup — a cell at Alexandria.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>The first half of The Walking Dead’s seventh season has focused on introducing new leaders and their respective communities. Rick, for his part, still has to meet Ezekiel — and his pet tiger Shiva — while Maggie has to get Gregory to fall in line. Then there’s still Alexandria to tend to as Rick is likely to face mounting pressure at home now that the community has seen the horror of crossing <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=51>Negan</span> — including Spencer and Olivia’s deaths as well as having to watch as Aaron (Ross <span data-scayt_word=Marquand data-scaytid=53>Marquand</span>) is beaten by the Saviors upon his return home. &nbsp;</p><p>All told, The Walking Dead parted ways with three series regulars during the first half of season seven: Nichols, <span data-scayt_word=Yeun data-scaytid=54>Yeun</span> and <span data-scayt_word=Cudlitz data-scaytid=55>Cudlitz</span>. The drama started season seven with its highest tally of series regular characters to service as the Scott M. <span data-scayt_word=Gimple-led data-scaytid=58>Gimple-led</span> drama continues to build out its <a href=#>sprawling world</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Walking Dead also set up a new mystery as a shadowy figure is revealed to be watching Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) as he stands guard at Alexandria. As the mystery individual heads toward Alexandria, viewers realize that it’s the same person who was following Rick and Aaron from the lake.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>What did you think of The Walking Dead‘s <span data-scayt_word=midseason data-scaytid=59>midseason</span> finale?
