Mel Gibson is having a later career resurgence here and it’s just so great to see with the actor taking on some interesting roles that are of a much different variety than he played years ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s leaning into a certain aspect of his personality that is playing well on the big screen and this next movie looks ridiculously funny with a twinge of a thriller vibe as well. Now we get a chance to see the first extended trailer for Last Looks.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Last Looks</a> will star Mel Gibson as Alastair Pinch, a hard-drinking Hollywood <a href=#>actor</a> who might have a few dirty secrets from his past. Whether he’s able to remember them at all is a different story, but there is the thought among the industry that he’s killed his wife. That’s where Charlie Hunnam comes in, starring as Charlie Waldo, a reclusive minimalist who also happens to be a disgraced former Los Angeles Police Department detective. He’s pulled back into the game as part of an investigation in just what Pinch has been up to and the two former something of an unlikely bond. Check out the <a href=#>trailer</a> for Last Looks.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Ok, I’m all in here. For starters, Mel Gibson is every bit the entitled Hollywood star in this one, leaning heavily into the drinking while also bringing about a larger-than-life personality that’s clearly a reason his character has enjoyed so much success. Pitting him with and also against Hunman’s character looks pretty hilarious with the movie also suggesting a darker side and tone behind some of the laughs. Frankly, it all looks like it works with Mel Gibson ringing in as near-perfect casting.&nbsp;</p><p>Last Looks is based on the Howard Michael Gould novel of the same name. It is part of a series that follows the Charlie Waldo character and there is some chance this movie is part of an ongoing series of films before it’s all said and done. In addition to Mel Gibson and Charlie Hunnam, a number of other notables are involved here. Morena Baccarin who’s brought in to bring Waldo’s character out of trailer life and into the work of private investigation. Others include Rupert Friend, Lucy Fry, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Dominic Monaghan" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Dominic Monaghan</a>, Clancy Brown and Method Man.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t the only bigger production Mel Gibson has in the works either. He’s also set to star in the John Wick spin-off prequel <a href=#>The Continental</a>. The story will take place in the 1970s, well before John Wick himself has come on the assassin scene. Gibson will play Cormac, someone likely at odds with Colin Woodell who will play a younger version of Winston, the Ian McShane character from the films.&nbsp;</p><p>It won’t be long until we get to see Mel Gibson in Last Looks. The movie is set to go into wide release on February 4th of this year. It’s been in the work for some time now, first starting production all the way back in 2019. But if this early trailer is any indication, it was worth the wait.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2illaF6qLXBrKanZZyWwLV5y6impKtencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
