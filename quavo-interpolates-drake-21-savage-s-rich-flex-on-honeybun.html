Given that it’s a free(ish) forum for public opinion, it doesn’t take long for people to air out their unadulterated thought and gain some sort of validation from the public. That’s especially true when it comes to rap beef and it appears that some feel as though <a href=# class=text-word rel>Quavo</a> might have a bone to pick with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>. With the release of the Atlanta rapper’s new single, “<a href=# rel>Honeybun,</a>” several references to Her Loss left many confused about the status between the former tourmates.</p><p>It’s one line in particular that fueled the suspicions of tension between the two artists. “N***as singing like Diana Ross, n***a/ I don't wanna hear no sorry for my loss, n***a,” Quavo raps on the record. Though this doesn’t necessarily pinpoint an issue, Internet conspiracy theorists felt like Quavo referenced Her Loss in an unflattering way. However, there’s more than enough evidence available in this song alone to debunk this theory.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-clears-rich-flex-for-quavo>Drake Clears “Rich Flex” For Quavo</h2></span><p>Though that one bar, in particular, led some to believe that Quavo took shots at Drake, the fact that he interpolated “Rich Flex” from the <a href=# class=text-word rel>21 Savage</a>-assisted Her Loss is a clear indication that the two remain on good terms. On the hook for the single, Quavo flips the heavily meme’d intro for the chorus, rapping, “Honeybun, can you do somethin' for me?/ Can you go automatic just for me?/ Tommy gun, can you do somethin' for me?/ Can you call Al Capone for me?” Even though some felt like Quavo mocked Drake, the Canadian rapper, along with his Atlanta counterpart, would've likely had to clear the use of their song beforehand.</p><p>The latest release from the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Migos</a> rapper marks his third drop of 2023, which seems to be a strong indication that his solo album is on the way. The rapper took a rightful hiatus following <a href=# class=text-word rel>Takeoff</a>’s passing but returned to the limelight at the beginning of the year. He and Drake rang in the New Year together at <a href=# rel>Diddy’s party</a>. Since then, Quavo’s released “Without You,” a tribute to Takeoff, and most recently, “Greatness.” Check out his new single above and let us know what you think of Quavo’s latest single.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoByfpJmqK6ZpqR6qrrTnqmpp5yWwaa%2FjJ2pmqOVYn9yedKarZqflah6s7XCoWSfpJWterC6jKGmp52pl8Kv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
