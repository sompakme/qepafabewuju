James caught endless flack for leaving his hometown of Cleveland in search of a title, but with two greats at his side, the trio brought two chips to the Magic City: one in 2012, another in 2013.</p><p dir=ltr>All that glory came at a cost, as Miami is still paying a pretty penny for their erstwhile big man in Bosh. Bron and Bosh joined the Heat during free agency in 2010, according to <a href=#>ESPN</a>. The 6'11" center got millions, but really cashed in before the 2014 campaign (notably after the championships were won and done) when he signed a five-year $118 million mega-deal, according to <a href=#>Givemesport</a>. However, by the 2016-2017 season, blood clot issues derailed the 11-time All-Star. He didn't play a single game.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In 2017, Bosh's time with the Heat was done: As&nbsp; <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a> reported, the team retired his jersey and officially released him from the roster.&nbsp;The only problem? As the <a href=#>Miami Herald</a> noted, they still owed him over $52 million. Insurance covered "$29 million of the remaining amount,"&nbsp;according to <a href=#>ESPN</a>. The team ate the rest. Bosh, who hasn't suited up since 2016,&nbsp;has been getting "twice-monthly installments of $434,393" since 2017 and will continue to cash those checks until 2022, according to <a href=#>HeatHoops'&nbsp;Albert Nahmad</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGlhaX16e9Geq6KqlZl6osDHpZytnaNiwLW1y6VkoJ2kqbavs4ymoKWkmaS7tHnFq6amZaSdsqq%2BjJ%2Bmq6WVp3q1scCmqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
