Among her cutting- edge tools are <span data-scayt_word=microcurrent data-scaytid=37>microcurrent</span>, oxygen, <span data-scayt_word=microdermabrasion data-scaytid=38>microdermabrasion</span> and radio-frequency devices. “I use <span data-scayt_word=microdermabrasion data-scaytid=39>microdermabrasion</span> on the whole body because it’s nice to prep the skin everywhere, and radio frequency increases collagen production by 20 percent,” she says.</p><p>Even though Los Angeles is one of the world’s most legendary beauty capitals, some boldfaces attending the Academy Awards rely on their New York gurus to be on hand for the hours up to red-carpet arrivals.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Inline%20Graphics%20(Product%20Only)/2016/Oscars/THR_oscars-embeds2x.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>“I arrive on February <span data-scayt_word=23rd data-scaytid=40>23rd</span> to prepare my patients,” says Dr. David Colbert, a Manhattan dermatologist whose following includes everyone from Naomi Watts to Mick <span data-scayt_word=Jagger data-scaytid=41>Jagger</span>. This visit, he will be tending to nominees <a href=# id=auto-tag_jennifer-lawrence data-tag=jennifer-lawrence>Jennifer Lawrence</a>, <span data-scayt_word=Cate data-scaytid=42>Cate</span> <span data-scayt_word=Blanchett data-scaytid=43>Blanchett</span> and Michael <span data-scayt_word=Fassbender data-scaytid=44>Fassbender</span>, along with Robin Wright, Sienna Miller and Michelle Williams. He plans to give them all his Triad treatment ($800-$1,200), a three-step process of <span data-scayt_word=microdermabrasion data-scaytid=46>microdermabrasion</span>, laser toning and a gentle lavender acid peel. For <span data-scayt_word=Fassbender data-scaytid=45>Fassbender</span>, he prescribes his Stimulate Serum with extracts of coffee <span data-scayt_word=Arabica data-scaytid=47>Arabica</span> and <span data-scayt_word=goji data-scaytid=48>goji</span> berry as well as silk peptide, to be applied daily leading up to the big night ($160). “It’s an instant wake-up call for male skin, no matter what someone did the night before,” he maintains. Lawrence gets his <span data-scayt_word=Illumino data-scaytid=49>Illumino</span> Brightening mask, containing epidermal growth factor, and coconut bio cellulose ($110). “Jennifer wants to have that extra glow,” he explains. “This gives a massive influx of antioxidants, which stimulate collagen production and make the skin look luminous.”</p><p>Vargas, too, is prescribing coconut for her clients. “I treat skin all over with coconut compresses,” she reveals. “They are anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and hydrating; they prevent breakouts and make skin radiant.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Supporting actress nominees Kate <span data-scayt_word=Winslet data-scaytid=51>Winslet</span> and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as well as Patricia <span data-scayt_word=Arquette data-scaytid=52>Arquette</span> and Sofia <span data-scayt_word=Vergara data-scaytid=53>Vergara</span>, are relying on New York <span data-scayt_word=esthetician data-scaytid=54>esthetician</span> Tracie <span data-scayt_word=Martyn data-scaytid=55>Martyn</span>, who heads west for the week, toting along her <span data-scayt_word=Resculptor data-scaytid=57>Resculptor</span> machine and delivering her Red Carpet Facial, which includes lifting <span data-scayt_word=microcurrent data-scaytid=58>microcurrent</span>, light therapy, organic ingredients and natural <span data-scayt_word=cosmeceuticals data-scaytid=59>cosmeceuticals</span> ($585). “I use multi­colored LED depending on the skin challenge I am facing — green for discoloration, blue for breakouts, and amber and red for fatigued skin,” says <span data-scayt_word=Martyn data-scaytid=56>Martyn</span>. “It’s very effective and gentle before the big event.”</p><p>Dr. Patricia <span data-scayt_word=Wexler data-scaytid=60>Wexler</span>, a Manhattan dermatologist who famously performed liposuction on Joan Rivers’ back so she would fit into a red carpet gown, says the fact that the Golden Globes and Oscars are now closer together, has made beauty planning easier for her celebrity patients. “They come in to New York a couple of weeks before the Globes for their fillers and toxins, and that lasts, so now they just come in to get polished before the Oscars with something like my Red Carpet Peel” ($450). Another Manhattan cosmetic dermatologist, Dr. Howard <span data-scayt_word=Sobel data-scaytid=61>Sobel</span>, says he treated two nominees and one former Oscar winner within the last couple of days who are then planning to fly back out for the Academy Awards. “Besides the obvious Botox and fillers, what has become the rage is to remove age spots and freckles with <span data-scayt_word=Fraxel data-scaytid=62>Fraxel</span>. They are no longer cute on the face, and they are signs of ageing on the decolletage and hands. Because of big HD TVs, there is more of an emphasis on treating all exposed skin areas” ($2500 per area).</p><p>Colbert has become so busy with awards season that he has installed a satellite office in Beverly Hills. “We don’t allow <span data-scayt_word=cellphones data-scaytid=66>cellphones</span> in the collagen beds,” says Colbert. “Apart from stimulating <span data-scayt_word=colla­gen data-scaytid=67>colla­gen</span> all over the body, the beds give a sense of well-being, which is important when you need to look poised in front of millions of viewers” ($350).</p><p>A version of his story first appeared in the March 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
