Before the panel, Newhart — still possessed of crack comic timing cloaked in endearing stammers and pauses — told The Hollywood Reporter that after the wildly popular and critically praised six-season run of his first CBS sitcom The Bob Newhart Show ended in 1978, he knew he’d eventually return to the network with a new series — and, in a move that would have presaged current revival trends, he briefly considered rebooting the original."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But at a packed tribute panel Thursday night at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, the 88-year-old comedian and his former co-stars reminded attendees that beyond that landmark exit there were eight full seasons of laughter and fond memories to celebrate.</p><p>Before the panel, <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=3>Newhart</span> — still possessed of crack comic timing cloaked in endearing stammers and pauses — told The Hollywood Reporter that after the wildly popular and critically praised six-season run of his first CBS sitcom The Bob <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=5>Newhart</span> Show ended in 1978, he knew he’d eventually return to the network with a new series — and, in a move that would have presaged current revival trends, he briefly considered rebooting the original.</p><p>“I knew I was coming back to television because I loved it — I loved television, the immediacy of the audience,” said <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=7>Newhart</span>, who toyed with reviving psychiatrist Bob Hartley. “We had considered maybe picking up the show five years later or something like that. Then we decided to not go that direction, because we’d used six years of material! Suzanne <span data-scayt_word=Pleshette data-scaytid=9>Pleshette</span> also wanted to do a Broadway show.”</p><p>Instead, <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=10>Newhart</span>, who was performing in New York, found inspiration in the lobby of the hotel he was staying. “I realized how similar a hotel was to what The Bob <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=11>Newhart</span> Show had been,” he recalled. “The patients were the guests at the hotel, and no matter how crazy they were, you had to do what they wanted you to do, and you go along.” He pitched the idea to CBS, who teamed him with former Taxi writer Barry Kemp.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>The two conceived a second <span data-scayt_word=eponymously data-scaytid=16>eponymously</span> titled series, casting <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=14>Newhart</span> as successful <span data-scayt_word=DYI data-scaytid=18>DYI</span> author Dick Loudon, the new owner of a quaint Vermont bed-and-breakfast who along with his supporting wife Joanna (Mary <span data-scayt_word=Frann data-scaytid=19>Frann</span>) found himself frequently flummoxed by his guests, quirky staffers like handyman George Utley (Tom Poston) and a slew of eccentric local townspeople.</p><p>While the show premiered in 1982 to high ratings, <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=20>Newhart</span> admits the series didn’t fully click <span data-scayt_word=comedically data-scaytid=22>comedically</span> until the end of its second season, being afforded a rare — back then and even more so now — opportunity to experiment and refine its approach. That entailed eliminating characters that didn’t work, like pathological liar Kirk <span data-scayt_word=DeVane data-scaytid=23>DeVane</span> (Steven <span data-scayt_word=Kampmann data-scaytid=24>Kampmann</span>) whose dishonesty made the studio audience hesitate to laugh. In his place, the series made a number of comic discoveries who became regulars along the way, including Julia Duffy as spoiled heiress-turned-hotel maid Stephanie <span data-scayt_word=Vanderkellan data-scaytid=25>Vanderkellan</span> and, later, Peter <span data-scayt_word=Scolari data-scaytid=102>Scolari</span> as her alliterative yuppie beau Michael Harris, who produced Dick’s local cable series.</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=629 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bi0a7895-embed.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>“We were finding ourselves,” <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=27>Newhart</span> recalled. “We introduced Julia, and that was a gift — she’s so talented. She and Peter, and their vapid life, their relationship — so I think like, in middle of the second year, we were off and running.”</p><p>Duffy told <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=29>THR</span> that while her first season guest stint as Stephanie wasn’t as hilariously vain and shallow, she still knew she was in for something special. “It wasn’t just another acting job because it was a huge deal for me that I got to work with Bob,” she remembered. “I’d always wanted to. In fact, I watched his old show, and I remember when it went off the air, and I thought to myself, I was always hoping I’d get to go up for that show for some guest role, and now, I’ll never get to work with Bob.”</p><p>Once she was freed from another quickly canceled series, <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=30>Newhart</span> invited her back permanently and the definitive Stephanie took form. “Any comedic idea you came up with, you could do with Stephanie, because she had a ridiculous amount of confidence in herself,” said Duffy. “She could do all kinds of things, and her reaction to the ordinary world wasn’t like anybody else’s, because she found it all amazing and a little sad, compared to the world she’d come from. To me, it was like playing an alien, almost, and I thought that was so much fun.”</p><p>When <span data-scayt_word="Scolari's" data-scaytid=32>Scolari’s</span> second season guest role was also expanded to regular status, Duffy said she and the former Bosom Buddies star (who is currently filming on the East Coast but sent a loopy video of congratulations to the panel) found “instant” chemistry as the equally superficial paramours. “We rarely even discussed a scene — we just both heard it the same way, and didn’t have to discuss it. We’re very different people, but when it comes to comedy, we were like of the same cloth.”</p><p>But perhaps the biggest, most inadvertent and most enthusiastically received were a trio of characters first intended as one-off gags in the show’s second episode: the off-kilter backwoodsman Larry, his brother Darryl and his other brother Darryl, played by William Sanderson, Tony <span data-scayt_word=Papenfuss data-scaytid=34>Papenfuss</span> and John <span data-scayt_word=Voldstad data-scaytid=35>Voldstad</span>, respectively, who would appear in around two-thirds of <span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=33>Newhart’s</span> subsequent episodes, even though the <span data-scayt_word=Darryls data-scaytid=37>Darryls</span> never uttered a word until the series finale. The reaction of the studio audience to their first appearance was palpably uproarious.</p><p>“They came in and they were an immediate hit,” <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=38>Newhart</span> recalled during the panel. “As soon as the show was over, I went to the writers and I said, ‘We have to have these guys back!’ That’s one of the magical things about having an audience. They told us … because they got 10-15 seconds of applause every time they walked in. And every time they left, they got another 10-15 seconds.”</p><p>“We put all those people in the audience,” Sanderson quipped to <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=40>THR</span>, remembering that first entrance. “No, it was a shock, and I love Bob for insisting on a live audience. He says, ‘You get the feedback.'” He gives great credit to <span data-scayt_word=Papenfuss data-scaytid=113>Papenfuss</span> and <span data-scayt_word=Voldstad data-scaytid=41>Voldstad</span>, classically trained actors who were patient about their lack of dialogue. “They seem minimalist, but they have great backgrounds, and they listen very well. I owe them an <span data-scayt_word=unpayable data-scaytid=45>unpayable</span> debt.”</p><p>“They were magical,” <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=46>Newhart</span> said of the trio. “I think Larry, Darryl and Darryl, and maybe a certain loyalty maybe the audience had toward me, bought us the two years until we were able to come up with Julia and Peter.”</p><p>Sanderson also still savors what has to be second most memorable moment in the <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=48>Newhart</span> finale, when the <span data-scayt_word=Darryls data-scaytid=49>Darryls</span> finally speak their only word of dialogue, shouting “Quiet!” at their chatterbox new wives. “I could feel the energy coming from both of them — they just exploded. The audience, luckily, laughed.”</p><p>The panel was attended by several familiar faces in <span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=52>Newhart’s</span> inner circle, including his wife of 55 years, Ginny, and their children and grandchildren; Duffy’s husband and Dark Shadows actor Jerry Lacy (who also penned two <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=54>Newhart</span> episodes); Dolly Martin, the wife of the late comedian Dick Martin, who directed more than 30 episodes of the sitcom; Barbara <span data-scayt_word=Rickles data-scaytid=57>Rickles</span>, the wife of the late comic Don <span data-scayt_word=Rickles data-scaytid=58>Rickles</span>, <span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=55>Newhart’s</span> closest friend; entertainer Steve Lawrence and iconic game show hosts Alex <span data-scayt_word=Trebek data-scaytid=60>Trebek</span> and Peter Marshall. And eventually, talk did turn to that legendary finale.</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=761 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bt1_3250-embed.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=61>Newhart</span> repeated his oft-stated “true story of how this show ended,”that it was his wife, while the couple was attending a party in Beverly Hills along with <span data-scayt_word=Pleshette data-scaytid=63>Pleshette</span>, who first brainstormed the finale’s epically meta definitive moment: after a surreal setup in which all of the townspeople became wealthy and even more eccentric when the region surrounding the Stratford Inn was bought up by Japanese investors, much to Dick’s befuddlement — he wakes up in the familiar bedroom of The Bob <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=62>Newhart</span> Show next to <span data-scayt_word=Pleshette data-scaytid=67>Pleshette</span> as Emily Hartley, revealing that the entire second series was just a bad dream had by his original TV character. (<span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=69>Newhart’s</span> executive producers have publicly disputed <span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=70>Newhart’s</span> version of events, claiming the inspiration as their own).</p><p>The biggest feat was keeping <span data-scayt_word="Pleshette's" data-scaytid=76>Pleshette’s</span> appearance secret — from the studio audience, from the press, and even from many in the cast and crew. “Suzie was two <span data-scayt_word=soundstages data-scaytid=77>soundstages</span> over, brought in at the last minute. No one knows she was there,” recalled <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=74>Newhart</span>. When a floater panel was finally moved to reveal the bedroom set during filming, “the audience began to applaud — they were applauding the bedroom set! They didn’t know Suzie was in bed or I was in bed,” laughed <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=75>Newhart</span>. “To me, it was a Monty Python&nbsp;kind of moment, that we knew the audience, they knew us, and it was kind of a wink-wink nudge-nudge, and that’s the way they took it. You’d hear people, ‘Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!‘”</p><p>While <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=80>Newhart</span> has no plans for a <span data-scayt_word=Newhart data-scaytid=81>Newhart</span> revival (citing both the passing of <span data-scayt_word=Frann data-scaytid=82>Frann</span> and Poston, he also noted “That’s for much younger people”) or a full-time return to television (“That would be a death sentence — my wife would kill me!”), the actor is enjoying seeing his status in pop culture reflected via nods in modern series like Mad Men and The Marvelous Mrs. <span data-scayt_word=Maisel data-scaytid=87>Maisel</span> (he revealed that the latter series’ running gag of aspiring <span data-scayt_word=midcentury data-scaytid=88>midcentury</span> comics passing <span data-scayt_word="Newhart's" data-scaytid=86>Newhart’s</span> standup material off as their own similarly happened to him in real life).</p><p>And he expects that he’ll reprise his Emmy-winning role as Arthur “Professor Proton” Jeffries on CBS’ The Big Bang Theory and/or its prequel spinoff Young Sheldon at some point. “I usually do one a year, sometimes two. They write really funny stuff, and it’s a great cast to work with,” he says, still ready to put his indelible spin on a punchline. “I always say I still have my fastball — but it’s more like a change-up now than it is a fastball.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOm6abZZ6axKmt0a1krKCfrHq4rdJmmKWln6jBbr7Em6aorJWZeqLAjJyZrGVhZn13gJdvZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
