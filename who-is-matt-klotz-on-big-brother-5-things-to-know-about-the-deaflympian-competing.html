The 27-year-old was born and raised in Cameron Park, California, and currently lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During an interview with DeafPeople.com, Matt revealed that he does not come from a deaf family, stating, “This is simply the way I was born. I wasn’t diagnosed with deafness until I was two years old since newborns were not regularly screened for hearing at the time”. He explained that although he learned to lip-read early on, it wasn’t until he received hearing aids that he heard his parents speak for the first time.</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">“I won’t let anyone in on my little secret of lip-reading,” he vowed. In “First Impressions of the New Cast” video interview with Sharon Tharp, Matt revealed in the Diary Room that he has the ability to lip-read from a distance or up close, but he plans to keep this skill under wraps as it could give him a significant advantage in the game. After watching several seasons of Big Brother, Matt considers himself a “fair fan”. He expressed his primary strategy in the Big Brother house is to “try to secure the first Head of Household (HOH) to ensure others approach him for alliances, reducing his worries”.</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Nevertheless, he will refrain from going “all out” in some challenges to avoid burning bridges prematurely. The 25th season of Big Brother presents a robust cast, including Matt, who breaks new ground as the first hard-of-hearing contestant in the show’s 23-year and 25-season history. He will be making history in the 25th season alongside Jag Bains, the first participant from the Sikh community. At the 2013 Summer Deaflympics, Matt won two gold medals in the 100-meter backstroke, and he also competed in the 50-, 100-, and 200-meter backstroke events in the 2017 Summer Deaflympics, taking home three gold medals. The Deaflympics occur every four years, mirroring the Olympics schedule.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK3RpJiroZWtrq56wqikaK%2BYpHqqv4ymmK2sXaC5sMDZZqanZZKetG6u0airoZ2iYoJuwMeipaCrXam8brfNqK5mmZKkwrV506GcZpyVlrOtxcypoJqmXZi8rrzEraCnn19ohnmFl24%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
