Criminal defamation and terrible lies would have ended my career if it hadn't been for God.That is not what you use womanhood for. Age is no excuse for being extremely wicked and devilish, this person has dated men far older than me. If I wasn't smart enough, there were back-to-back lies, evil, and plots to bring me down from her at the height of my storm.Only if I made a single mistake.But no way you will talk or explain some loose lives won't want to pick holes. They just want you down. Agents of darkness.I NEVER RAISED A FINGER ON ANY PARTNER IN MY LIFE, INCLUDING THIS GIRL, but it's all over blogs and media that I beat her to the point of forced labour (beat a 9-month pregnant lady, how evil can that be)?"
