Technically, you really didn’t kill anybody, you know what I'm sayin'?" Antney said before describing the claims as fabricated.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Let's stop talking about that now because all these kids think that you're the number one killer. And let's not talk about it no more because now you’re a dad, you got two sons," she continued. "Come into that and think about your kids looking at something. And these kids are looking at you a certain kind of way of something that’s fictitious. It was done for rap.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Podcast host Ugly Money Niche looked baffled by the claim, pressing Antney further for confirmation on her claims. He asked her for a clear answer on if Gucci Mane actually murdered Pookie Loc. "No," she said, shaking her head.</p><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - OCTOBER 28: Gucci Mane performs on stage during Votelanta Music Festival at The Dome Atlanta on October 28, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Last year, Wop appeared at the 2022 REVOLT Summit where he admitted he wished he "wouldn't have said what I said."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I didn’t know when I got on the stage, that was gonna happen, [that] I was gonna say that," he added. "I ain’t like, ‘I’m bringing negative energy.’ It just really came out.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
