That came to light recently when Page Six revealed that the mega-star had been binging 90 Day Fiancé to help pass the time during her two recent pregnancies. They spoke to one of the stars of the show, Yara Zaya about how she found out that RiRi was watching her show. “She DM’d me back in February 2021 when she was pregnant with her first baby. She told me she loved my storyline, and loves to watch the show," Zaya told the publication.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Zaya then expanded on how surprised she was to hear back from Rihanna. “I always loved her. I reached out to her first, but had no idea that she would ever reply back to me.” Page Six also notes that the two now follow each other on Instagram. They also claim that Zaya isn't even the only 90 Day Fiancé star to receive DMs from RiRi. Angela Deem, another star of the show was also reportedly contacted by the "Work" singer.

She and A$AP Rocky had an adorable photo shoot with their two children <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>RZA</a> and Riot earlier this month. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Fans are still debating</a> whether or not they like the baby's name. Some think it's connection to Rocky's newest single comes off as corny while others think it's better when combined with the middle name to make Riot Rose.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rihanna hasn't had much of a public presence since doing the Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year. Just last week, her successor was named. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a> is set to take the stage during halftime of the 2024 Super Bowl and he's already discussing what aspects of his Las Vegas residency he will bring with him.
