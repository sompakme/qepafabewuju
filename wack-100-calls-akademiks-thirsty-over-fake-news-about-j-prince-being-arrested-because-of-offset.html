Prince and Offset</a>. Since the untimely death of rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Takeoff</a>, a line has been drawn in the sand. Prosecutors are diligently working on a case against <a href=# rel>Patrick Clark</a>, the suspect accused of murdering the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Migos</a> star during a dice game last November in Houston. Takeoff was also with several of J. Prince's relatives, thrusting the family into the spotlight of criticism. Prince's son was heavily ridiculed for appearing to walk past Takeoff's dead body. The family has repeatedly expressed their distress over his loss.</p><p>However, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Offset</a> apparently hasn't been as forgiving. J. Prince suggested there was more behind the scenes with Set and <a href=# rel>issued scathing insults</a> toward the grieving rapper. The backlash was swift, and the viral moment was widely shared. Things dissipated, but a news report on social media claimed Prince had been arrested for threatening Offset.</p><span><h2 id=h-offset-j-prince-lay-rumors-to-rest>Offset & J. Prince Lay Rumors To Rest</h2></span><p>Thr rumor seems to have started after MyMixtapez posted a screenshot. It read, "Wack100 & his sources say J Prince has been arrested by Feds for threatening Offset & the remaining Migos are in protective custody." It was a far-fetched story, especially because no one else reported on the findings. Akademiks quickly reposted, earning a reaction from Offset, who called the report false. Wack 100 also chimed in because he certainly wasn't happy to see his name dragged through a fake scandal. He fired off a direct message to Ak.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">"[Akademiks] </a>thirst move," the music manager wrote. "If you don’t have the content of me saying this don’t stamp it.. But I get it&nbsp;#clickBait&nbsp;is the New New Testament….. Dude ain’t nobody to hide from&nbsp;#Gtfoh&nbsp;@offsetyrn&nbsp;you have a good day today." Prince also entered the chat, albeit without saying too much. He shared a video of himself enjoying gray skies in a lavish estate, and in the caption, wrote, "A lie ain't nothin to tell."</p><p>Meanwhile, Akademiks has continued to share updates about him being called out. However, he didn't address using his platform to fuel the fire of this beef with fake news. Check out more about this above from all involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYFxf5Vmrpqbm2J%2BcXyMnJilpKNirqytw56koqOjYsGptdGsq7Jln6uys3nFmqKeZZ6axLR5wJumrqxdn3qxvsinmp5lkpq2r7OMmqmrnaOpsqV5wZ6amq2jmnqwsoyonZ%2Brlak%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
