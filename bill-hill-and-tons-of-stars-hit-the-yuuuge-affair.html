Hollywood has not exactly embraced Donald Trump‘s campaign for president (so far, his big endorsements are from Hulk Hogan and Scott Baio).

But a bit more than a decade ago, on Jan. 22, 2005, it was a different story. Trump married model <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=2>Melania</span> <span data-scayt_word=Knauss data-scaytid=3>Knauss</span> in a million-dollar wedding covered by every major media outlet, a boldface affair at his Palm Beach, Fla., estate <span data-scayt_word=Mar-a-Lago data-scaytid=4>Mar-a-Lago</span>. More than 350 guests attended, including Bill and <a href=# id=auto-tag_hillary-clinton data-tag=hillary-clinton>Hillary Clinton</a>, Russell Simmons, Mort <span data-scayt_word=Zuckerman data-scaytid=5>Zuckerman</span>, Heidi Klum and Barbara Walters, who inexplicably arrived in a white Volvo station wagon.</p><p>Today, it would be easier to get Paramount to <span data-scayt_word=greenlight data-scaytid=6>greenlight</span> another <span data-scayt_word=Zoolander data-scaytid=7>Zoolander</span> sequel (Trump appeared in the 2001 original) than to get a celebrity to admit they attended the nuptials. <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=8>THR</span> made 89 calls seeking comment from those who witnessed The Donald’s third time in the marital ring, to no avail. But they were there, to witness that rarest of occasions — a Trump event that showed self-restraint. (It was the influence of <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=9>Melania</span>, who shut down her Apprentice-host <span data-scayt_word="fiance's" data-scaytid=12>fiance’s</span> idea of having NBC telecast the wedding live.) <span data-scayt_word=Cellphones data-scaytid=13>Cellphones</span> and cameras were confiscated (Katie Couric managed to hide her camera, surreptitiously taking photos throughout the evening). Reporters and paparazzi tried to bribe the bandleader into sneaking them in as orchestra members. One gesture of promotion did slip past the publicity police: Outside of the baronial Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, a small plane passed overhead toting a fluttering banner that read, “<span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=11>Melania</span>, You’re Hired.” Interviews with the wedding’s floral designer, <span data-scayt_word=cakemaker data-scaytid=15>cakemaker</span> and others reveal details of the event that still ranks on top 10 lists of the world’s splashiest weddings.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>THE RING</strong></p><p>Always one to make a statement — and never one to pass up a good deal — Trump reportedly procured the 12-carat, emerald-cut Graff ring for $1.5 million, half its retail price (or, depending on who’s being asked, for free, in exchange for a promotion on The Apprentice) because the London jeweler figured publicity would make up the difference. If 12 carats seem paltry (Beyonce’s diamond clocked in at 18), consider <span data-scayt_word="Melania's" data-scaytid=17>Melania’s</span> <span data-scayt_word=10th data-scaytid=18>10th</span> anniversary rock registered at 25.</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/rexfeatures_454190d-ring%20embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-scayt_word=Melania’s data-scaytid=19>Melania’s</span> 12-carat ring.</p><p><strong>THE DRESS</strong></p><p>After many fittings documented in a 14-page Vogue cover story, <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=20>Melania</span> chose a sleeveless hand-beaded <span data-scayt_word=duchesse-satin data-scaytid=27>duchesse-satin</span> Dior gown accentuated by an oceanic veil. The dress boasted almost 300 feet of white satin and 550 hours worth of embroidery — but the bride could barely walk in it. So for the poolside <span data-scayt_word=afterparty data-scaytid=28>afterparty</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=21>Melania</span> changed into a body-hugging Vera Wang <span data-scayt_word=hand-ruched data-scaytid=29>hand-ruched</span> silk tulle Grecian dress slit up to the knee. <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=22>Melania</span> carried no bouquet, but rather a set of family heirloom rosaries. There was only a maid of honor (<span data-scayt_word="Melania's" data-scaytid=23>Melania’s</span> sister, Ines, who also wore Wang), though the bride did commission a page’s outfit from Dior for 7-year-old Cameron Burnett, the son of Apprentice producer Mark Burnett. Trump had two best men: sons Donald <span data-scayt_word=Jr data-scaytid=31>Jr</span>. and Eric.</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/GettyImages-84316722_0-Back%20of%20dress%20EMBED.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The $100,000 Dior dress sported a 13-foot train and 16-foot veil.</p><p><strong>THE GUEST LIST</strong></p><p>Before daughter <span data-scayt_word=Ivanka data-scaytid=32>Ivanka</span> Trump read from the Bible and Metropolitan Opera soprano Camellia Johnson sang “<span data-scayt_word=Nessun data-scaytid=33>Nessun</span> <span data-scayt_word=Dorma data-scaytid=34>Dorma</span>,” the pastor asked if the guests would support the new union. Getting a tepid response, he thundered, “One more time!” The crowd replied throatily, “We will!” Attendees represented the worlds of politics (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rudy <span data-scayt_word=Giuliani data-scaytid=35>Giuliani</span>, George <span data-scayt_word=Pataki data-scaytid=36>Pataki</span>, Chris Christie); music (P. <span data-scayt_word=Diddy data-scaytid=37>Diddy</span>, Usher); business (Steve Wynn); sports (Derek Jeter, Don King); fashion (Anna <span data-scayt_word=Wintour data-scaytid=38>Wintour</span>, Heidi Klum); and, of course, television (Matt Lauer, Kathie Lee Gifford, Simon <span data-scayt_word=Cowell data-scaytid=39>Cowell</span>, Leslie <span data-scayt_word=Moonves data-scaytid=40>Moonves</span>, Jeff <span data-scayt_word=Zucker data-scaytid=41>Zucker</span>). Paul <span data-scayt_word=Anka data-scaytid=42>Anka</span> complained about being seated behind a pillar during the ceremony; Hillary Clinton and Kelly <span data-scayt_word=Ripa data-scaytid=43>Ripa</span> talked about their kids; <span data-scayt_word=Shaquille data-scaytid=44>Shaquille</span> O’Neal couldn’t get his massive feet to fit under his table; Billy Joel hung out with the orchestra and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. “Let me tell you something,” says Sandra Rose, the wife of the wedding’s bandleader. “If someone had dropped a bomb on that place, it would have wiped out an entire generation of famous Americans.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/zumaamericasseven143937-Invite%20EMBED.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A wedding invitation.</p><p><strong>THE DECOR</strong></p><p>After a spirited competition for the gig, <span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=45>Melania</span> selected New York event designer Preston Bailey to create, in his words, her “very classic, very white” wedding. “She said, ‘I want something that is very elegant but not over-the-top,’ ” he recalls. The new Mrs. Trump wanted a “very creamy and white color palette,” says Bailey, and she requested “very romantic, traditional flowers: roses, hydrangeas, vernaculars, some orchids.”</p><p>The reception, held in the just completed Versailles-like ballroom at <span data-scayt_word=Mar-a-Lago data-scaytid=47>Mar-a-Lago</span> (price tag: $35 million), featured tables swathed with white satin <span data-scayt_word=cutwork data-scaytid=49>cutwork</span> lace laid over white brocade damask, with linen napkins wrapped in white <span data-scayt_word=dendrobium data-scaytid=50>dendrobium</span> orchids. But the piece de resistance were Bailey’s imposing 5-feet-tall centerpiece candelabras (“to give the room height”), submerged in hydrangeas, tea roses, orchids, <span data-scayt_word=ranunculuses data-scaytid=51>ranunculuses</span> and gardenias. The flowers were such a hit that Bailey ended up doing <span data-scayt_word="Ivanka's" data-scaytid=52>Ivanka’s</span> and Eric’s weddings as well.</p><p>The groom, Bailey remembers, “was really, really excited. He really enjoyed his wedding.” Were there any glitches? “Whenever you do a Trump wedding,” he says with a laugh, “glitches are not allowed.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/pacificphotos075405_0-Embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite what a recent spate of stories about Trump’s butler might imply, the billionaire is rarely at home in <span data-scayt_word=Mar-a-Lago data-scaytid=53>Mar-a-Lago</span> (which includes a private social club that he built in response to being reportedly denied membership to the Everglades Club). Lesley <span data-scayt_word=Abravanel data-scaytid=55>Abravanel</span> of the Miami Herald says the city of Palm Beach made it difficult to launch the club, with members characterized as <span data-scayt_word=“WASPy data-scaytid=56>“WASPy</span> upper crusty types, con artists, socialites, scammers and wannabes.”</p><p><strong>THE MUSIC</strong></p><p><span data-scayt_word=Melania data-scaytid=57>Melania</span> was as focused on the soundtrack to her nuptials as every other detail: She wanted a full-string orchestra (46 strings), augmented with saxophone, piano, bass and drums. Music was provided by the august Michael Rose Orchestra of Palm Beach, its members dressed in all-white tuxedos, which played a steady stream of <span data-scayt_word=Gershwin data-scaytid=61>Gershwin</span>, Kern, Porter and other staples of The Great American Songbook (“Our Love Is Here to Stay,” “But Not for Me” and, of course, “I’ll Take Manhattan”). The <span data-scayt_word=afterparty data-scaytid=58>afterparty</span>, complete with a DJ, raged on until the wee hours, but it was during the formal reception that Joel, <span data-scayt_word=Anka data-scaytid=59>Anka</span>, Tony Bennett and Elton John each serenaded the happy couple. “It was really something out of a movie, like Sabrina,” remembers Rose. “Only this was, as Donald would say, ‘<span data-scayt_word=Yuuuuge data-scaytid=65>Yuuuuge</span>.’ “</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>THE CAKE</strong></p><p>The dinner, prepared by Jean-Georges <span data-scayt_word=Vongerichten data-scaytid=67>Vongerichten</span>, featured an appetizer of steamed shrimp salad with champagne vinaigrette and a main course of beef tenderloin; as a favor, each guest received an individual chocolate truffle cake to take with them. (Walters showed hers off live on The View the following week.)</p><p>But the star of the culinary offerings was the wedding cake, a seven-tier chef-d’oeuvre that measured 70 inches in diameter and weighed more than 200 pounds. <span data-scayt_word="Melania's" data-scaytid=68>Melania’s</span> original idea was a blue and gold cake, but “she didn’t like the sample,” Cedric <span data-scayt_word=Barberet data-scaytid=72>Barberet</span>, the former pastry chef at <span data-scayt_word=Mar-a-Lago data-scaytid=69>Mar-a-Lago</span> who baked the final opus, tells <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=70>THR</span>.</p><p>In the end, they settled on a gold-and-white, classic yellow sponge cake flavored with orange zest, filled with butter­cream and soaked in Grand <span data-scayt_word=Marnier data-scaytid=76>Marnier</span>. It featured 2,000 individually constructed flowers spun from sugar. “I don’t think anyone has done anything like this before,” <span data-scayt_word=Barberet data-scaytid=75>Barberet</span> recalls telling the bride.</p><p>It took his team two months to construct the platform and wiring infrastructure for the cake, “which looked like a big bouquet,” he says. But with all the wires, none of the guests could eat any of it, so <span data-scayt_word=Barberet data-scaytid=78>Barberet</span> and his team baked 5-inch-tall mini “backup cakes.” As for the original, “we served it to the staff after the wedding,” <span data-scayt_word=Barberet data-scaytid=79>Barberet</span> recalls. “We had some very hungry employees.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Meena/EMBED%20CAKE.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 200-pound cake took two months to design.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/THR_The-New-York-Issue-2016.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnoKS5qsDInKpmppWswHDA0a6kqatdrLKlsMinnmallaGur7XAZpmipJxitaq4y2ZvcWhgbYVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
