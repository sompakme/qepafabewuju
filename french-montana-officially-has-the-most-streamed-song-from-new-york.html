It landed on Montana's 2017 album Jungle Rules and has racked up more streams than the rest of the songs on the album combined. The song sports a feature from Swae Lee, who was blossoming into a white hot superstar in 2017. Many fans think he played a much bigger role in the songs success than just a mere assist. "This should be Swae Lee ft. French" one of the top comments on a post announcing the news reads. "The most streamed song out of New York got carried by n*gga from Mississippi" another comment agrees. Check out the reactions to the announcement below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-french-montana-and-swae-lee-break-new-york-streaming-record>French Montana And Swae Lee Break New York Streaming Record</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of French Montana now having the most-streamed rap song in New York's history?
