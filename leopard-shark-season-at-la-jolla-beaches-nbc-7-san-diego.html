Leopard sharks are back in huge numbers off the coast of La Jolla and the majority of them are during a special time in their lives.
&#34;They show up every summer when the water is really warm, and they like this particular spot because it’s especially calm,&#34; said marine biologist Andrew Nosal. &#34;All of these leopard sharks are pregnant females, and they are here because they are incubating their developing embryos."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"All of these leopard sharks are pregnant females, and they are here because they are incubating their developing embryos."</p><p>Nosal is a professor with the University of San Diego's Environmental and Ocean Sciences Department. He has been studying leopard sharks since 2007.</p><p>"They are completely harmless, as long as you’re not a crab or a fish, and in fact, most of the species off our shore are completely harmless to humans," he said.</p><p>Leopard sharks are found in other areas along the West Coast, but Nosal said they seem to have a particular affinity for La Jolla.</p><p>It’s that time of the year when leopard sharks return to La Jolla for a few weeks in droves to incubate their embryos. The sight? Well, it's fin-credible. NBC 7's Audra Stafford reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.nbcsandiego.com/2021/08/N5AF-VO1-LEOPARD-SHARKS_KNSDEWPS_00-00-4407.jpg><p>"The sharks that we see this summer – it’s the same sharks, the same individuals that are coming back year after year. So this place is really special to them," he said. "That’s called philopatry, which means home-loving. They come back every single year."</p><p>Nosal said leopard shark season typically lasts from late-June to early-December, but the peak months when we see the most sharks are August and September.</p><p><a href=#>Everyday California</a> and other companies offer kayak, paddle board and snorkeling tours that will get you up close to the animals. You can also just wade right into the water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.nbcsandiego.com/2021/08/N6AF-TOSS-2-AUDRA-LEOPARD-SHARKS08-13-2021.jpg><p>"When the sharks are shallow, that’s all you have to do and they are swimming around your legs," Nosal said.</p><p>Whichever method you choose, Nosal said it is important to look, but don't touch.</p><p>"We need to remember that we are guests here and we need to respect the animals that live here," he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67CrJinnJmatLB6wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVnlp67bq%2FRnpuimpyaerS1xqGrZqSVpL2ivsNmqqGZoqDAbr7Erayrpl2pvG64wGahqKSclnq4rdOeqaxlmaN6pb7Or5ysZ2JrhnN%2FkXBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
