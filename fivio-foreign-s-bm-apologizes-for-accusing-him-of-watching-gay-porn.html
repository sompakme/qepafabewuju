“I went through his porn history, it was gay s****. He gets around, and he does not use a condom. Y’all gotta be careful. This man is like a sex addict,” Jasmine shared on Instagram Live in September."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I should have not went live and said those things and they were NOT TRUE! I was angry with a lot of things.” No word on what brought about Jasmine’s change of heart. The post comes a month after the B.I.B.L.E. star released a statement, claiming that his child’s mother was upset about his budding relationship with fellow rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Mellow Rackz</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“Out of respect for the mother of my children, I am going to handle this issue privately. Never have I ever been accused of not taking care of my children and my responsibilities. As an artist, I travel for work to take care of my family. I love my kids and their mother and it’s unfortunate that she’s made her frustrations with a relationship that I have with Mellow [Rackz], public.”</p><p>Shortly after releasing his statement, Fivio and Mellow called it quits just before her birthday.&nbsp;</p><p>Share your thoughts in the comment section below.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaX12gI9mnaKumaR6p7vRnqCgpqNir655wKmmpaeXnsemv4yfpqtlkZiwtr%2FIp55moJmierCyjLCYrZuYnruoecaasGaon6e7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
