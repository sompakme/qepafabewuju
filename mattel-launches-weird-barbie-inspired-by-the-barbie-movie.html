She also features short tousled hair and markings on her face to emulate a doll that’s been played with just a little too much.”</p><p>It echoes Greta Gerwig’s interpretation; the director told <i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.rollingstone.com>Rolling Stone</a></i> last month she was often the recipient of “hand-me-down Barbies” that “had already gotten a haircut by the time I got them”.</p><p>“It was like, ‘Well, we have to do that’,” she said. “It felt almost like a spiritual conduit to the world of play through that Barbie.”</p><p>Some, however, have (rightly) argued that so-called Weird Barbies are made – not sold.</p><p>“They should’ve just sold a regular Barbie with all the tools you might need to make her into weird barbie,” one person <a class=body-link href=# title=twitter.com>tweeted</a>.</p><p>“Sorry, weird barbie can’t be bought, she must be made,” <a class=body-link href=# title=twitter.com>agreed</a> another.</p><p>Or, as one journalist put it for <i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.insider.com>Insider</a></i>, “the weird Barbie being sold by Mattel just isn’t weird enough”.</p><p>“Sure, she is ‘Made to Move’, complete with limbs that twist every which way and features one of the worst haircuts you’ve ever seen, but that’s … it?” the piece reads.</p><p>“Where are her missing clumps of hair, showing the unrealistic rows of holes that line her scalp? Where are her ripped pants and mismatched top, picked from years of random outfits? Why isn’t she tattooed from head to toe with remnants of childhood doodles? Where are her mud splatters and grass stains from playing outside?</p><p>“The doll does a great job of memorialising McKinnon’s Weird Barbie but does less in the way of actually capturing the Weird Barbie experience.”</p><p>The doll is one of seven products in an expanded collection stemming from the <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=0dd4a74c2b66ca2c02041c7adc0fa282 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>billion-dollar blockbuster</a>, including various Barbie and Ken dolls modelling outfits they wore in the film.</p><p>“With the latest editions to the collection, we are offering even more ways for fans to immerse themselves in Barbie Land and celebrate the characters and stories they see on screen,” Mattel’s executive vice president and chief brand officer, Lisa McKnight, said in a statement.</p><p>“Barbie continues to be the cultural event of the summer, and as we chart Mattel’s path forward, she will continue to serve as an icon of empowerment and inspiration for generations to come.”</p><p>Mattel’s Weird Barbie will be available for pre-order starting August 18, and will ship on or before May 31, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8%2BaqZ6mpJ67qHvKopusZ52WwbWxy2ajmq2emLWmv4yloKahpJqxprDIraCopl2ssqq%2Bw2aZmqqSnrJutc2sp6KqlZl6o8WMoKmerJFitKa%2B1qKerGWdpMOqsY6nnLCrXajBsL7YaJmdcWeYgaexwmtnn5xlaIZ2f8RqnWxoaZiEdoCWbm9p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
