They are going to be writing in more devious storylines for her and building her into a complete psycho." The source went on to say that Gillian had a discussion to see if show bosses would leave the door open for Emma, but "they wanted a dramatic death".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3392591e518b-gillian-kearney-british-soap-awards-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e8VyTLpPcU-J data-wc=11><strong>The actress, 45, is leaving at the end of the year</strong></p><p id=eS274S9CNs-c data-wc=78>Other big names to exit the soap in the past year include Kelvin Fletcher, Bill Thomas and John Middleton.
