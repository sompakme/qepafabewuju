The top lightweight athletes had the eyes of every fight fan on them. According to the release of the PPV buys, everyone at home was also interested. The fight garnered 1.2 million buys last Saturday. However, the fight is second to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Conor McGregor</a> vs. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Floyd Mayweather</a>. McGregor vs. Mayweather pulled in a staggering 4.6 million buys. However, the buy rate for Davis-Garcis is still a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">huge victory for boxing</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In recent years, MMA may have taken over <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">mainstream popularity</a>. However, boxing is still king when it comes to PPV buys. For context, the UFC had a huge event earlier this month. Israel Adesanya and Alex Pereira headlined UFC 287 for the middleweight crown. The company was hoping for 600,000 buys for the event. So, while the UFC seems to be the more talked about sport these days. Boxing is still raking in the cash over MMA.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gervonta-davis-vs-ryan-garcia-pulls-massive-numbers>Gervonta Davis Vs. Ryan Garcia Pulls Massive Numbers</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The fight last Saturday was everything that encapsulates boxing. A heated rivalry, the spectacle of the intros. Finally, an ending that was fitted for this chapter of the rivalry. Davis earned <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the crown of the lightweight king</a> with his TKO victory over Garcia. Garcia was unable to answer the referee's ten count after a brutal body blow from Davis. However, the drama wasn't just unfolded in the ring. According to Oscar De La Hoya, his life was endangered at the arena. Also, De La Hoya's business partner Bernard Hopkins was banned from ringside for the event. Davis' camp had Hopkins banned after a dust-up at the weigh-ins.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">De La Hoya told fans on Instagram that he wasn't seen after the fight due to threats. The boxing legend was in the corner of Garcia for the fight. However, it now seems that all things are in the clear for De La Hoya. As for Garcia, it was a tough loss. But he more than showed his talents on boxing's biggest stage. However, Davis' victory has only continued to grow his legacy inside the ring.
