On that day, he and some friends were being driven from a standup gig when the vehicle was struck by a tractor-trailer on a New Jersey highway, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>CNN</a>.&nbsp;Rushed to a nearby hospital, Morgan was listed in critical condition. His longtime friend, mentor, and fellow comedian, James "Jimmy Mack"&nbsp;McNair, was killed.</p><p>In August, <a href=#>The Washington Post</a> reported that Morgan&nbsp;broke his ribs, nose, and leg in the crash, which also left him comatose for two weeks with "no memory" of the incident. According to the comedian's attorney, Benedict Morelli, Morgan also "suffered a traumatic brain injury" during the crash.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you have a traumatic brain injury it takes a very long time to find out how you're going to do and how much you're going to recover," Morelli told the Associated Press, via <a href=#>NBC News</a>&nbsp;in the immediate aftermath of the wreck. At the time, Morelli was uncertain about his client's fate. "We're hoping and praying to get him back to where he was. But the jury's out."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tlan5ye9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjK2pmpupYrqwvsaapWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
