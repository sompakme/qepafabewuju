On last week’s show, Matt Riddle performed the RKO on Xavier Woods, which is Orton’s finisher. Orton even told Riddle not to steal his finishing move after the show, but Orton did it himself this week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Orton even told Riddle <a href=#>not to steal his finishing move</a> after the show, but Orton did it himself this week.</p><p>It seems unlike Randy Orton, Matt Riddle was very excited at the fact that Orton hit the Bro Derek. While speaking in a backstage interview after Monday Night RAW, Matt Riddle revealed he was very elated at Orton using his finisher and is excited about their future together.</p><p>“I had to get the key. Randy locked it up earlier, you know how it is. Bro, Randy hitting the Bro Derek was amazing. And last week I hit the RKO. Who knows, next week we could both be doing Floating Bros all over the place. Honestly, I don’t even know what to say. I don’t know what to do. All I know is I gotta get back to Randy. We gotta talk gameplans, we gotta talk the future, we gotta talk merchandise, we gotta talk scooters, we gotta talk speedos, we gotta talk a lot, a lot of things. Love you all. Peace, I gotta go. Scooter… away… yeah, yeah!”</p><p>The very odd pairing of Randy Orton and Matt Riddle is certainly a hit with fans as they are really liking the two’s dynamic. We wonder whether a proper push will mean team RK-Bro will be getting a shot at the RAW Tag Team titles eventually as AJ Styles and Omos recently called them out on RAW Talk.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49vZmlpX6KutcCMq6CdnJyaerex0bJknrCTnsGmsIyana2domK%2ForrDsmSoqqSku27B0p6bZqCZqHqntc2iqqGhnpx6rrvVnmSopl2sxKZ50ZquaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
