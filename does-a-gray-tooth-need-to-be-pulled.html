However, if you have swelling in the gums around the grey tooth, pus drainage, or pain when you chew, you may have an urgent problem.<h2>What happens if your tooth goes grey?</h2>When only one or a few teeth turn gray or blue, it might be because the teeth have died. Though you might think of all teeth as lifeless, at their center are living pulp and nerves. If trauma or infection has caused damage, the pulp and nerves can die, and the tooth turns dark pink, gray, or black.<h2>Does a grey tooth have to be pulled?</h2>Assuming there is no infection, watch to make sure that this gray tooth gets loose around the same time as the other front tooth. This will typically happen at age 5-7. If It doesn't get loose on its own, again, most likely you will have to get the tooth pulled so that the permanent tooth can come in safely.<h2>Can you fix a grey tooth?</h2>Gray teeth may not go back to their original color unless they're treated with whitening agents. If you don't get the results you want from at-home treatment, your dentist may recommend in-office bleaching or veneers.<h2>Do You Have a Dark Tooth? Here's the Fix!</h2><p></p><h2>Why has my front tooth gone grey?</h2>Tooth Trauma<p>Anything that cuts off blood flow to the tooth can lead to the tooth going gray. The tooth may also have gray stains from mental distress. Trauma to the tooth, however, may not result in a change in color for months or even years.</p><h2>Why do older people's teeth turn grey?</h2>As we get older, the outer hard tissue covering our teeth, called enamel, wears away and exposes the darker dentin beneath it. This can cause our teeth to appear more gray or yellow rather than white.<h2>Is a discolored tooth dead?</h2>A dying tooth may appear yellow, light brown, gray, or even black. It may look almost as if the tooth is bruised. The discoloration will increase over time as the tooth continues to decay and the nerve dies. If you experience any symptoms of a dying tooth, it's important to see your dentist right away.<h2>How long does it take for a tooth to turn grey?</h2>If a milk tooth receives a hard knock, then it may discolour and start to turn grey, yellow or black in colour. This often happens two to three weeks after the initial accident. This means that the tooth's blood supply has been affected and it is struggling to get the necessary amount of blood.<h2>Why is my tooth going black?</h2>Tooth decay: One of the leading causes of teeth turning black is tooth decay, which can result from the build-up of plaque and tartar. Poor oral hygiene can result in tooth decay, although this is reversible in the early stages. However, when teeth turn black further treatment is necessary.<h2>What drugs cause grey teeth?</h2>Gray teeth stains can be caused by the use of tetracycline antibiotics in children under the age of 8 or pregnant mothers. Tetracycline is an antibiotic medication designed to fight bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, gonorrhea, acne, rosacea, and others.<h2>Can you fix a discolored tooth?</h2>Dental Bonding<p>This resin can be molded and shaped to fit whatever tooth has discoloration. The resin can also be color-matched to the rest of your smile or made to be as white as you'd like. Dental bonding can be done in a quick visit to your dentist. The surface of your tooth is prepared for the resin to adhere to.</p><h2>Can tooth decay be reversed?</h2>Decayed Enamel Can't be “Re-Grown”<p>But as of yet, it's physically impossible. Once a tooth has a physical cavity (opening or hole) inside of it, there is no feasible way to help the enamel grow back on your own. Instead, the cavity will gradually worsen, due to the bacterial infection inside of the tooth structure.</p><h2>What is a dying tooth?</h2>A dead tooth occurs when those tissues are damaged and the blood supply to the tooth is lost. It may be painful or may cause no symptoms at all. A dead or dying tooth should be treated quickly because it can become infected and have negative effects on the jaw, gums and other teeth.<h2>What does necrotic tooth mean?</h2>Necrotic teeth are dead teeth — dead because the nerve at the root is dead. This condition, also called necrotic pulp, occurs when the pulp within the tooth no longer has a viable blood supply, so the tissue dies.<h2>How long is a tooth wobbly before it falls out?</h2>Once loose, a baby tooth can take anywhere from a few days to a few months to fall out. To speed up the process, you may encourage your child to wiggle her loose tooth. The new permanent tooth should begin to appear in the lost tooth's place soon after, though it can take several months to grow in completely.<h2>What do gray teeth mean?</h2>There's always the chance that your tooth is turning blue or gray because it's dead. A healthy tooth consists of nerves and living pulp. If you notice a tooth or two turning gray, blue, black, or dark pink, the nerves and pulp within the tooth may have died.<h2>Does a dead tooth turn black?</h2>Will a dead tooth go black? If a dead tooth is left untreated, it will go black as the internal tooth tissue dies and decomposes. If the dead tooth has been root treated with a tooth-coloured treatment, the tooth may not go completely black, although it may darken slightly.<h2>How do you know you have tooth decay?</h2><p>Symptoms</p><li>Toothache, spontaneous pain or pain that occurs without any apparent cause.</li><li>Tooth sensitivity.</li><li>Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold.</li><li>Visible holes or pits in your teeth.</li><li>Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth.</li><li>Pain when you bite down.</li><h2>How long can you leave a dead tooth in your mouth?</h2>Once a tooth is damaged or decaying, it's only a matter of time before it dies. Depending on how heavy the damage, the tooth could die within a matter of days or even a couple of months. Darkened or discolored teeth are often the first sign that your tooth is on its way out.<h2>Can a dead tooth heal itself?</h2>Teeth are unlike other parts of the body in that they cannot heal themselves when they become damaged. The only way to solve an infection is to remove the infected parts to save the natural tooth.<h2>What causes a single tooth to discolor?</h2>Many individuals do not always have natural bright white teeth; especially as they get older! In fact, tooth discoloration can occur for different reasons. Common reasons of tooth discoloration could be a result of damaged enamel of a tooth, dental work, and stains caused by foods, beverages, or tobacco use.<h2>Are root canals painful?</h2>For many patients, getting a root canal is no more painful than getting a cavity filled thanks to the use of local anesthetic and modern endodontic techniques. Most people report feeling comfortable throughout their procedure, feeling pressure and movement at times, but not pain.<h2>Why is my tooth grey after root canal?</h2>It is not uncommon for teeth to turn darker in color either before or after being treated with a root canal. Deposition of pigment within the tooth from the nerve, usually due to major trauma, can cause the tooth to turn either gray or brown.<h2>Can grey teeth be whitened?</h2>Teeth whitening procedures often work better on yellow or orange teeth but can lighten and brighten the appearance of gray teeth. Your dentist may recommend at-home whitening treatments using strips or trays for less severe graying, or they may propose in-office procedures for more advanced discoloration.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlkWK0s63YZquop6Sdeq%2BxxJ1kraddl7JuvNSlo56c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
