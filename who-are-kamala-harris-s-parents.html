"When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn't quite imagine this moment, but she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shyamala Gopalan and Donald Harris (from India and Jamaica, respectively) immigrated to the United States to pursue doctorate degrees at the University of California at Berkeley. It's there that they met and engaged with radical political thinkers—a huge departure from the career of their daughter. The two eventually separated in 1971.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read on to learn more about the vice president-elect's parents and their lives.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">They met as students.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The UC Berkeley campus was a hotbed for radical politics and student activism, helping to form the undercurrent of the '60s civil rights movement. It was in this environment that Shyamala and Donald first met.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Donald, then a student pursuing his doctorate degree in economics, recalled speaking at an off-campus space to a group of students about the parallels between the United States and his home country of British-colonized Jamaica, in which a small number of whites had propped up a "native Black elite" to mask social and economic inequality, he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/kamala-harris-parents.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The New York Times</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Afterward, Shyamala, then pursuing a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, approached Donald with questions: Her view of India's own British colonial system was more sheltered, having been raised by a senior civil servant, but she wanted to hear more. "This was all very interesting to me, and, I daresay, a bit charming," Donald told the Times. "At a subsequent meeting, we talked again, and at the one after that. The rest is now history." He also recalled her attendance at the student meeting as "a standout in appearance relative to everybody else in the group of both men and women."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Donald recalled his desire to attend UC Berkeley after receiving a prestigious scholarship from the British colonial government as untraditional, since most scholarship recipients at the time went on to study in Britain, rather than the United States. "From a distance and perhaps naïvely,” he told the Times, the United States seemed a "lively and evolving dynamic of a racially and ethnically complex society." Then, after reading a news story about student activists heading to the South to campaign for civil rights, he was hooked. "Further investigation of information about this University convinced me I had to go there," he said.</p><img alt="a crowd of students leave campus for lunch through the sather gate of the university of california at berkeley photo by © ted streshinskycorbiscorbis via getty images" title="Berkeley Students at Lunchtime" width=3540 height=2835 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-576840428-1605031899.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Ted Streshinsky Photographic Archive</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A crowd of students leave campus for lunch at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Shyamala had dreams of becoming a biochemist that were undercut by Lady Irwin College, a British-founded school that allowed her (and other Indian women) to get only a degree in home science. Her brother, Gopalan Balachandran, told the Times, "My father and I used to tease her like nobody's business. We would say, 'What do you study in home science? Do they teach you to set up plates for dinner?' She used to get angry and laugh. She would say, 'You don't know what I'm studying.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later, she took matters into her own hands, applying to UC Berkeley and—to her family's astonishment—getting accepted. "[Our father] was only worried: None of us had been abroad," her brother recalled. "He said, 'I don't know anybody in the States. I certainly don't know anybody in Berkeley.' She said, 'Father, don't worry.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Both Shyamala and Donald were steeped in the radical political culture on campus.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Times reported that Shyamala met Cedric Robinson, a young Black man from Oakland, while waiting in line to register for classes in 1959. The two went on to become lifelong friends, with Robinson (who became a political activist during his student days) going on to write five books and earn tenure in the Department of Black Studies and the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His most well-known book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848296/black-marxism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition</a>, lists Shyamala as one of his friends who helped formulate the ideas in it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two would together join the Afro American Association, which the Times noted as "the most foundational institution in the Black Power movement," as written by Donna Murch in her book Living for the City: Migration, Education and the Rise of the Black Panther Party. (For instance, Huey P. Newton, cofounder of the future Black Panther Party, was a member.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the group limited its membership to those only of African descent, some recalled to the Times that Shyamala's status as a former subject of British colonial rule and her being a person of color welcomed her into the association. "She was part of the real brotherhood and sisterhood. There was never an issue," former member Aubrey LaBrie told the newspaper. "She was just accepted as part of the group." Later, when Shyamala and Donald separated, the Afro American Association would prove integral in helping her raise her daughters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Donald, too, joined the Afro American Association, describing it to the Times as his introduction "to the realities of African-American life in its truest and rawest form, its richness and complexity, wealth and poverty, hope and despair."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Friends and acquaintances of the time recalled the couple's deeply political and, at times, argumentative nature. "You could tell she was 'for the people,' quote unquote, even though she had an aura of royalty about her," said Anne Williams of Shyamala. "Here was a woman, deeply brown, and yet she could have flowed from one set to another in terms of race."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Baron Meghnad Desai, an economist born in India, recalled meeting the couple before a dinner party to the Times. She was "fiery and radical but not Marxist in any sense," while Donald "did take a serious interest in radical political economy, but he was a calm and patient arguer."</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Shyamala never planned on staying in the United States.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2003, during Kamala's bid for district attorney of San Francisco, Shyamala told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SF Weekly" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">SF Weekly</a>, "I came to study at UC Berkeley. I never came to stay. It's the old story: I fell in love with a guy, we got married, pretty soon kids came."</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Their marriage ended in 1972.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After having two children together, Kamala and Maya Harris, Shyamala filed for divorce in 1972, per the Times, following relationship complications after Donald took a tenured teaching position at the University of Wisconsin. Instead, Shyamala raised her daughters in California.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Kamala's 2018 memoir, The Truths We Hold, she wrote, "I knew they loved each other very much, but it seemed like they had become like oil and water," adding that "had they been a little older, a little more emotionally mature, maybe the marriage could have survived. But they were so young. My father was my mother's first boyfriend."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Donald later expressed his frustration with the custody agreements over their children, writing in an essay for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jamaicaglobalonline.com/kamala-harris-jamaican-heritage/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jamaica Global Online" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Jamaica Global Online</a> that his interactions with his children "came to an abrupt halt in 1972" and that he lost a "hard-fought custody battle in the family court of Oakland, California." Still, he wrote, "I persisted, never giving up on my love for my children or reneging on my responsibilities as their father."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the same essay, he affectionately recalled taking both Kamala and Maya with him on a trip back to his home country of Jamaica.</p>Upon reaching the top of a little hill that opened much of that terrain to our full view, Kamala, ever the adventurous and assertive one, suddenly broke from the pack, leaving behind Maya the more cautious one, and took off like a gazelle in Serengeti, leaping over rocks and shrubs and fallen branches, in utter joy and unleashed curiosity, to explore that same enticing terrain. I quickly followed her with my trusted Canon Super Eight movie camera to record the moment (in my usual role as cameraman for every occasion). I couldn’t help thinking there and then: What a moment of exciting rediscovery being handed over from one generation to another!<h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Shyamala became a prominent breast cancer researcher before her death.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shyamala's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=shyamala-g-harris&pid=125330757" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=obituary class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">obituary</a> proclaimed her as "a world-renowned scientist, a mentor, an activist, a mother" with "a career as a brilliant breast cancer researcher." Her work additionally took her to top research institutions like the University of Illinois, University of Wisconsin, Department of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, as well as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She also had 16-year tenure at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research at the Jewish General Hospital and the Department of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One of her greatest contributions was her seminal work in isolating and characterizing the progesterone receptor gene in a mouse-a momentous finding that transformed our understanding of the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue," her obituary read. "Her discovery sparked a plethora of advancements regarding the role of progesterone and its cellular receptor in breast biology and cancer."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2009, she died at 70 after a struggle with cancer.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Donald became a respected professor at Stanford University.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After leaving the University of Wisconsin, Donald joined Stanford as a professor of economics emeritus, where "he was a leader in developing the new program in Alternative Approaches to Economic Analysis as a field of graduate study," according to his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://web.stanford.edu/~dharris/professional_career.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="university profile" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">university profile</a>. Much of his work also revolves around "the process of capital accumulation and its implications for a theory of growth of the economy" in order to explain "the intrinsic character of growth as a process of uneven development," a concept in the Marxian school of economics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Stanford, Donald gained popularity with students, gaining criticism as "too charismatic" and a "Marxist scholar," or "a pied piper leading students astray from neo-classical economics," according to a 1976 story in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://archives.stanforddaily.com/1976/11/03?page=4&section=MODSMD_ARTICLE11" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Stanford Daily" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He eventually retired in 1998 to develop "public policies to promote economic growth and advance social equity."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Having returned home, he now serves as an economic consultant and adviser to Jamaica's government and various prime ministers.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Kamala hasn't mentioned her father much on the campaign trail, and he once criticized her for making a joke about her Jamaican heritage and smoking pot.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Kamala doesn't hesitate to praise her mother, there has been little mention of her father.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was not around after the divorce," Meena Harris, Kamala's niece, said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/kamala-harris-makes-her-case data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New Yorker" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The New Yorker</a>. "Their experience and relationship with blackness is through being raised in these communities in Berkeley and Oakland, and not through the lens of being Caribbean."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tension brewed in early 2019, when Kamala was still a contender in the Democratic presidential primary. When asked if she had ever smoked pot during an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh_wQUjeaTk" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Breakfast Club" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Breakfast Club</a>, Kamala said, "Half my family's from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The joke fell flat with many—including her father. In a statement he sent to Jamaica Global Online, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kamala-harriss-jamaican-father-wasnt-amused-by-her-joke-about-marijuana-use/2019/02/21/2d722658-35cb-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald wrote" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Donald wrote</a>, "My dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family's name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kamala's campaign has not commented on the incident.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since then, he has mostly stayed quiet on Kamala's Democratic nomination and subsequent electoral victory, and he'll probably also stay out of the political limelight as his daughter ascends to the White House. "I have decided to stay out of all the political hullabaloo by not engaging in any interviews with the media," he wrote in an email last year reviewed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/kamala-harris-father-pot-1176805 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Politico class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Politico</a>.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
