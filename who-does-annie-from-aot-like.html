After their meeting, the two gradually became closer enough for Kaya to believe they were in love.<h2>Is there a love interest in AOT?</h2>Attack on Titan is a bleak, dystopian anime that isn't exactly known for its romantic subplots. Still, there are a few characters who do develop feelings for one another over the course of the series, even if those relationships are far from the central focus of the show.<h2>Does Annie like Bertolt?</h2>Canon.
