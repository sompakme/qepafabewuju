John Dean passed away on June 13, 2010, at the age of 81, at his home in Varina, Virginia. Donna, his second wife, was left to care for him. It was a shock to her, she told the Associated Press, since her husband had been suffering from health issues but was still operating normally, so his death was unexpected.
