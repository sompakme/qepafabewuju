However, it has not been for the best of reasons. In fact, this has been the case for months now. Overall, the two are no longer together, and the toxicity between the two has everything to do with it. Moreover, Chrisean just gave birth to her son with Blueface, and there is already all sorts of outrage on Blue's side about the whole ordeal. As he has made crystal clear, he doesn't like how Chrisean has carried <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">herself on social media since giving birth.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the things that Blueface has taken exception to, is Rock going on Instagram and showing off her post-pregnancy body. In the video below from The Shade Room, you can see Rock in the gym for the first time since she gave birth. Furthermore, she is showing off what her body looks like since giving birth. She seems ready to hit the gym on a permanent basis, although some fans think it is too soon. For instance, there are those telling her that she needs to prioritize her baby, first and foremost.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chrisean-rock-on-the-gram>Chrisean Rock On The Gram</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Blueface just so happens to be one of those people as he went on a huge rant last night. He even claimed that his son is at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">risk of being molested while under Chrisean's care</a>. Moreover, he is planning on filing for custody if the situation doesn't improve. “In the first 48 hrs the baby been held an touch by 20 different people every time I check my fone it’s a new person holding the baby,” he wrote. “Here hold my 1 day old baby while I work out ass bitch smh. Who gone watch the baby.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Needless to say, the situation between these two is not improving, even after Chrisean gave birth.
