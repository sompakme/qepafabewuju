Whitfield revealed the shocking news while appearing on the "Mention It All" podcast. Why Whitfield? Well, she knew two very important people from the franchise: Lisa Vanderpump and her daughter, Pandora. "I knew Lisa Vanderpump before the show," revealed Whitfield (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, back in the day when they were starting Vanderpump Rules, they were like, 'We're starting this show, would you maybe wanna think about being on it?'" However, Whitfield turned down the offer in favor of her marketing career. "I got on my high horse and I was, like, telling Lisa and Pandy, 'I would never do reality TV, that is, like, so trashy.'"</p><p>Although Whitfield didn't feel that reality TV was the right lane for her at the time, she certainly had a great backstory. In addition to being close with Vanderpump and her daughter, Whitfield also once kissed "Vanderpump Rules" cast member Peter Madrigal. During an episode of "Watch What Happens Live," Andy Cohen presented Madrigal as a potential match for Whitfield. "What about Peter Madrigal, I know you made out with him," said Cohen (via <a href=#>Bravo</a>). "I'll go left, 'cause been there, done that," replied Whitfield.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoZ4R5fo6rnJqkmanGbr%2FHqK5mmqKuu6951qGgrZ6ZmrmledOuqaedlGKxsMPNZqGooZ6eu6h5wZ6dqKqVYr%2Bpu82yZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
