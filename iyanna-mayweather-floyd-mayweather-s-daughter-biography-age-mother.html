In October 2018, a music video titled&nbsp;</span><span>Oh Alright Remix</span><span>&nbsp;was released on YouTube.&nbsp;But a critical analysis of the views revealed that his striking style was central to his concerns.&nbsp;Iyanna has a YouTube channel and tries hard to keep it active.</span></p><p><span>But as the daughter of one of the most talented boxers of all time, she has achieved huge success on social media.&nbsp;With hundreds of thousands of people following her on Instagram and Twitter, Iyanna is nowhere below average in terms of social media presence.&nbsp;As for her popularity, Iyanna caught the public eye with lavish birthday parties sponsored by her father.</span></p><p><span>It doesn’t end there, her dad is known to spoil his daughter by giving her the most expensive things.&nbsp;On her 16th birthday, she invited musical artists such as Drake and Future to perform at her party and also received many gifts.&nbsp;This may seem like the highest of them all, but you will be amazed to know that on her 18th birthday, Iyanna Mayweather was gifted with an 18-carat “Canary PRISTINE” ring worth $5 million.&nbsp;Everything was glitzy at the birthday party celebrated by a host of celebrities.</span></p><p><span>All of these gifts made people wonder if she was her father’s favorite child.&nbsp;Another guess is that the boxer is probably trying to make up for his infamous relationship with Iyanna’s mother.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his mother?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As we mentioned earlier, Iyanna Mayweather is Floyd’s only child with his one time girlfriend, Melissa Brim.&nbsp;Brim is said to have first met the boxer when she was a teenager.&nbsp;By the time they started dating, Melissa already had a son, Devion Cromwell, from a previous relationship, but that was never a problem for Floyd, who even reportedly adopted the child out of love for his mother. .&nbsp;But things quickly soured between them after Melissa got pregnant with Iyanna.&nbsp;According to some sources, they had a falling out at the time and later separated.</span></p><p><span>After Iyanna was born, the pair came back together again, Floyd did his best to catch up with the past.&nbsp;He helped her open a boutique, Devanna Love Boutique, named after her children.&nbsp;In 2012, the once beloved couple broke up again.&nbsp;It was a lousy episode with allegations of physical abuse against Melissa by Mayweather.&nbsp;Floyd got in trouble with the law and was placed under house arrest for a few days.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGihqZa7r62Mppiyr5WWwamx0WadpaepmXqurdiwnJqsmJq%2FtHnDmqygoKSav26uyKieq5mgncZurcaeZKanpJ2ys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
