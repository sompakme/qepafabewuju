In fact, a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Leviss wants nothing to do with Sandoval. As of September, "Rachel and Tom have not spoken in nearly three months," the insider said, explaining that Leviss last spoke to Sandoval prior to checking into a mental health facility in June. At that time, Leviss "made the decision that it was healthiest to cut Tom out of her life completely."</p><p dir=ltr>On September 12, Leviss blocked the TomTom owner on Instagram when he wished her a happy birthday, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>. But Sandoval didn't appreciate being cut off. "I think [the social media block is] a little thirsty and immature personally, but [Rachel] is who she is," he told <a href=#>Extra</a>. "I still wish the best for her. I hope she's doing good and I hope she finds her happiness." Separately, Sandoval called Leviss "petty" for her decision to publicly share that she'd blocked him (via <a href=#>People</a>).</p><p>Leviss, meanwhile, has been busy ridding her life of anything that reminds her of her mistake. In October, she auctioned her infamous TomTom sweatshirt and lightning bolt necklace for charity, per <a href=#>People</a>. "I just don't want to see them, I don't want to have them in my possession. I will never wear them again," Leviss told fans on Instagram Stories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxibIJxgI6wn56qlWK%2Foq%2FHnqNmpJWrtrS%2FjK2mpmWjlrulu9Wao2arpJa7pXnAn6ueql2Ws6etyKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
