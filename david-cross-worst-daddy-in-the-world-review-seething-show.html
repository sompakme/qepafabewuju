At first, he seems content in his misanthropy, expressing hatred of the hipster, 30-something fathers whom he’s forced to make stilted conversation with in Brooklyn playgrounds.</p><p>Incredulous that anyone could serve jail time for murdering their toddler when casual negligence would be just as effective (and less incriminating), he incrementally shifts from his own failings to those of a pro-life God.&nbsp;</p><p>While the pacing can be a little slow overall, the night’s best routine sees Cross shift from Ron DeSantis’s legislative rewriting of Rosa Parks’s story in Florida schools to a hilariously demented equivocation of Hitler’s Final Solution. But it is then cratered by an unwise bit of roleplay with the audience, with not one but two volunteers making a mess of things. Happily, Worst Daddy survives this car crash to end with Cross irreverently rewriting the Old Testament to excellent effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJuforKlxY6wn5qsXam8br%2FEnmadmaaesW6v0aiqrGWnpL%2B0wIydmJ2cqWK2r3nToZxmr5%2BnuaV50Z6top2nZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
