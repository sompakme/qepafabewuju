So maybe that’s just a question of that happening.”</p><p>The first&nbsp;Father of the Bride&nbsp;was a major box office success when it was released in 1991. Steve Martin starred as an overprotective father struggling to let go of his daughter Annie, played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley. Newbern played Annie's fiancé (and later husband), while Diane Keaton starred as Martin's wife.

But now that a script exists, reunion whispers have reignited.</p><p>Though Newbern remained coy on details about the potential third film, he did reveal where he thought his character Bryan would be 22 years later. The sequel left off with Annie and Bryan moving to Boston from California with their baby for a job opportunity. But now?
