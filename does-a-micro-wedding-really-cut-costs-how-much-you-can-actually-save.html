HELLO!'s latest money-saving column with<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;UK Alliance of Wedding Planners</a> (UKAWP) elite member Valentina Ring from<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;The Stars Inside</a> explores what you can and can't save with a more intimate guest list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e2dcb5e55472-rebecca-carpenter-photography.jpg><p id=eF8rfMsmEPA data-wc=50>She said many couples are embracing the idea of a smaller guest list, liberated from the expectation that weddings have to be large or grand. They are choosing to invest their budget into elevating the quality of the experience for their nearest and dearest – which sound pretty good right?&nbsp;</p><p id=eRxH7LdkxVl data-wc=25>If you’re ready to celebrate your marriage vows but your wedding budget is causing you financial anxiety, then a micro wedding might be your answer…</p><h2 dir=ltr>How much money can you save with a smaller guest list?</h2><p id=eAPutFxiHGV data-wc=34>If you’ve started researching wedding services and suppliers to get an idea of costs, you may have already begun realising that most elements of a wedding scale with the number of people you have.</p><p id=eLQW8L8BX1 data-wc=16><strong>NEED TO KNOW:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Who should sit on the top table at your wedding? Dos and don'ts</a></p><p id=ey5rR9SlJYc data-wc=22>Let’s have a look at some concrete examples, such as catering, florals, beauty, stationery, cake, production and entertainment, furniture hire, and transport.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Catering</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3da3a921a925-rustic-wedding-table-rebecca-carpenter.jpg><p id=esG5VCH7S5p data-wc=50>Your catering and drinks expense is possibly the category where you can save most by cutting guests: these days you can easily spend £250 per head once you account for canapés, a seated meal, drinks, equipment, and staff – and that’s not even considering extra alcohol for the evening party.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Flowers</h3><p id=eEkXN0Jxbrry data-wc=40>Your floral budget won’t need to cover as much either, because you’ll have many fewer guests sitting down to dinner; filling a single table of 6-8 guests with flowers, candles and tealights can easily add up to £300 per table.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Stationery</h3><p id=eoW6djRGk1nT data-wc=26>You’ll also be saving on stationery by sending fewer save-the-dates and invites, as well as ordering fewer menus, table numbers, place cards, and thank you cards.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Beauty&nbsp;</h3><p id=eINkvwAF413- data-wc=26>Hair and make-up fees are based on bridal hair and make-up plus per-person costs depending on how many bridesmaids, mothers, and additional guests have beauty services.&nbsp;</p><p id=etSn7e_YUkhC data-wc=33>Having a cosier wedding means you can have a smaller bridal party, or you can get rid of the idea of bridesmaids altogether if it’s a tradition that doesn’t feel right for you.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Cake</h3><p id=evW1Szf4nBxf data-wc=27>A single-tier cake that serves 10 is a very different investment from a three-tier cake that serves 100; you could be jumping from £150 up to £1,000+.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Extras</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/6b9151839db8-couple-dancing-night-rebecca-carpenter-photography.jpg><p id=eXTRT0CnAUe5 data-wc=66>A smaller guest list also means that the scope required for production, furniture hire, entertainment, and transport is significantly simpler too: fewer chairs and tables to hire, a single live musician instead of an eight-piece band, one suspended chandelier instead of twelve, one taxi or minibus instead of two full-size coaches, a single PA system instead of a full dance floor set-up – and so on.</p><p id=e1FdLaeC4V data-wc=13><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to choose stunning wedding table settings and decor on a budget</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>What wedding costs will stay the same regardless of the guest list?</h2><p id=epWiUW2ebruu data-wc=45>There are, however, certain elements that – should you wish to include them in your wedding – cost the same regardless of whether you invite 20 people or 200. For example, the cost of having a registrar or celebrant officiating your ceremony remains the same.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Flowers</h3><p id=efDj3rkz4ra7 data-wc=62>When it comes to florals, as mentioned above, you can bring the overall cost down – but certain elements will cost what they do regardless of whether it’s just the two of you or there are hundreds of guests with you: a luscious floral arch, a bridal bouquet, a buttonhole for the groom, and flowers for your sweetheart dinner table, for example.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Stationery</h3><p id=eBQIawvne0g_ data-wc=41>A stationer will charge for design time for a bespoke stationery suite regardless of the number of items being printed, but – like florals – you’ll be able to spend much less overall by requiring fewer paper goods as a whole.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Beauty</h3><p id=elEYiGaLP1Jo data-wc=43>Hair and make-up artists will charge for a bride’s beauty services in the same way for a micro wedding as they do for a larger one, but – as stated above – you can save by not needing additional services for extra guests.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Photography</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ffe04b1cfd81-couple-fairytlights-rebecca-carpenter-photography.jpg><p id=eHeBBjf7LIq3 data-wc=60>Photographers and videographers generally have standard packages which are based on the number of hours of coverage, not the number of guests. However, most couples who elope or have a micro wedding have the flexibility to schedule the day in such a way that requires fewer hours of coverage (e.g. a six-hour package, instead of a 10 or 12-hour one).&nbsp;</p><p id=eMAl3-RLC7J6 data-wc=23>You certainly won’t need as long for your group shots, for dinner photos, or party photographs as you would for a large wedding.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Venue</h3><p id=ejP6K5Emqr5p data-wc=42>Your wedding venue is another category of expense where you can make great savings by having a small guest list. You won’t need to invest in exclusively hiring huge areas made up of multiple rooms – unless you want to of course!&nbsp;</p><p id=efJ4yJ2lERo4 data-wc=55>You’ll be able to broaden your search away from traditional hotels and over to restaurants, hotel suites, galleries, gardens, wine bars, and even nightclubs. Many of these will be able to offer you unique private spaces, with great indoor and outdoor options, as well as gourmet food and curated decor that won’t need much embellishment.</p><p id=eB1IyiFCpYBH data-wc=32>If you’re open to hosting your intimate wedding on a weekday and out of peak season (i.e. not in summer) you’ll have an even broader choice of venues, and even better prices.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/dff701c7af20-newlyweds-rocks-sea-rebecca-carpenter.jpg><p id=eWm6mZ064YDm data-wc=54>Another benefit is that venues tend to relax their requirements when it comes to intimate weddings: they won’t impose minimum food and drink spends, minimum number of nights for overnight stays, and typically won’t charge as much for cleaning or staff fees either, as smaller weddings cause less disruption and damage to venue grounds.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4L-5cnBST9d data-wc=45>There are of course certain types of venues where exclusive hire costs the same regardless of the size of the celebration – but that’s why you’ll benefit from thinking outside the box, reaching out to smaller, boutique venues and locations that aren’t conventional wedding venues.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUZcJJl9C03L data-wc=56>The secret is finding venues that target smaller groups for private hire, and who not only welcome this kind of booking but will be willing to create hire options tailored to you; rather than feeling like a "round peg in a square hole", trying to adapt wedding packages made for large weddings to your intimate gathering.</p><p id=e6I3vbbqKR8Y data-wc=44>So, it's definitely not true that every element is cheaper when having a small wedding – but it is true that by cutting the guest list you can significantly reduce the overall expense – while at the same time increasing the budget per person.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyl3pokK_S0G data-wc=40>It means you can still indulge in the things you love, work with amazing vendors, honour your priorities, and treat yourselves and your guests to a really personal, luxurious experience – without overextending yourselves beyond the figure you’re comfortable spending.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0mPPB7luWa8 data-wc=31>You could curate a menu of fine food and wine pairings, or order personalised dessert selections, which is precisely the kind of meaningful luxury every guest will truly enjoy and remember.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBHI7KwWvRc9 data-wc=44>Having a larger guest list often means that you find yourself spending a considerable chunk of money on things that don’t matter that much to you – and you have less control and breathing room for splurging on those things you love and cherish.&nbsp;</p><p id=echQS89qd-Jr data-wc=43>Many couples, particularly after the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, are reassessing their priorities in terms of starting families, buying houses, starting businesses, and much more – and being intentional with the money invested in their wedding day is more important to them than ever.</p><p id=eeO0CO4f1C data-wc=9><strong>FIND OUT:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to perfect your wedding invitation wording</a></p><p id=eorlPF_cBt data-wc=22></p><p id=es7TKjUYyVr data-wc=26><strong>Planning your wedding?
