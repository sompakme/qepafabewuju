Currently, many stars are spending time in Paris, where brands have been unveiling their collections for the upcoming F/W 2023 season. Among them is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ciara</a>, who's been booked and busy at a handful of events.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The 37-year-old seems to be stepping into a more mature era with her style, donning only black ensembles for her time in Europe, each one more eye-catching than the last. Of her many looks, our personal favourite is the sheer skirt she wore to Giambattista Valli's presentation, layered over a pretty bodysuit and decorated with tiny gems. Her hair has been long as of late, but for PFW, she switched things up with a short, dark bob that perfectly frames her face.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-a-body-party-in-paris>A "Body Party" in Paris</h2></span><p>Ciara attends the Giambattista Valli Womenswear Fall Winter 2023-2024 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on March 03, 2023, in Paris, France.

From the look on her face, it's obvious how confident she felt earlier today (March 3). Elsewhere in Paris, the mother of three stepped out to support Nina Ricci, once again stunning in a black gown. This one was far less revealing than Valli's, though it still hugged her curves, and created drama around her neck with a large flower.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Previously this week, at the Off-White runway, the "1, 2 Step" hitmaker looked like the ultimate cool girl. Inches of dark brown hair were worn in four braids in front of her shoulders, tucked under a beanie. Her brown eyes were hidden behind oversized black shades, and she left her chest bare under a bomber jacket. For bottoms, Ciara donned a knit skirt, keeping her warm in the cool winter weather.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Ciara Wears MSCHF's Big Red Boots</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the world of fashion, the Texas-born star was one of many celebrities to don <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">MSCHF's Big Red Boots</a>, marking her as something of a style icon.
