And, you know, his … his sorrows … ” “A white middle-aged American man walking around with his white middle-aged American sorrows?” replies his lesbian friend. “It’s a little hard to feel sorry for a guy like that.” Greer can afford this moment of metafiction because, by this third act of the novel, his hero has won us over, for all that he enjoys most of the blessings of existence.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Despite its lampooning of the literary world, Less <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">won this year’s Pulitzer prize for fiction</a>, prompting its publication in Britain. It introduces us to minor novelist Arthur Less as he finds himself abruptly single, having coasted through a studiedly casual not-quite-relationship with a vain younger man for several years. Less is “an author too old to be fresh and too young to be rediscovered, one who never sits&nbsp;next to anyone on a plane who has heard of his books”. The younger man, who happens also to be the son of his arch enemy, announces his engagement to someone else.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>While still not acknowledging to himself that he&nbsp;was in love all along and that his heart is cracked, if not quite broken, Less accepts a slew of writerly invitations that conveniently slot together to&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;round-the-world trip. Not only will he thus avoid the wedding, but sidestep the pain of turning 50 in&nbsp;company.</p>A twink-turned-daddy, Less has yet to make the adjustment from kissed to kisser<p class=dcr-epamsi>The various stages of this journey lend the novel its structure and, as is customary, provide both a parade of colourful characters and a voyage of self-discovery. They also neatly illustrate the scrabble-and-make-do that most freelance writers must resort to in order to survive, all those little jobs that make you feel like an author but that are not quite writing – “the crazy quilt of a writer’s life: warm enough, though it never quite covers the toes”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Greer mercilessly skewers the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">insecurity of authors</a> as well as the vanity of the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">literary industry’s self-absorption</a> in the face of its irrelevance to most people’s lives. The stealthy genius of this novel is that&nbsp;it simultaneously tells the life story of a&nbsp;basically sweet man whom the industry has eaten alive. Less’s&nbsp;undoing, perhaps, is that he has been loved by&nbsp;a&nbsp;genius – he passed his youth as the lover of a&nbsp;celebrated poet – so has fallen into the habit of seeing himself as on the periphery of things. A <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">twink</a>-turned-daddy, he has yet to make the adjustment from kissed to kisser, and wreaks emotional havoc on&nbsp;anyone drawn in by his air of baffled innocence.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>We first meet him in New York, where he has the humiliation of chairing a huge event for a wildly successful and wildly overrated science fiction writer. His next stop is Mexico, where he must take part in a panel discussion about his former lover’s genius. Then Italy, where an earlier novel of his, apparently brilliant in translation, is up for an obscure but well funded award: a sequence that catches particularly well the artificial camaraderie and false modesty of rivals thrown together for a&nbsp;prize. And so on to Germany, where he teaches a&nbsp;writing course entitled Read Like a Vampire, Write Like Frankenstein. There he has a fling with a&nbsp;besotted business student and it is from the intimate details the narrator lets slip about the way Less kisses (“like someone who has just learned a&nbsp;foreign language and can only use the present tense and only the second person. Only now, only you”) that the reader begins to suspect this story is being told not by some omniscient figure but by a&nbsp;character in it whom Less has underestimated. And then on to Paris, an ever less romantic journey across the desert in Morocco, a&nbsp;nightmarish food article he researches in Japan, and&nbsp;finally an Indian writing retreat. Here he plans to&nbsp;polish the rejected novel to perfection but, as the&nbsp;past reaches out to reclaim and challenge him, he&nbsp;is actually being prepared, we realise, finally to fall&nbsp;in love.</p><figure id=2c089519-39f4-4c38-a09a-365defef19ff data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Andrew Sean Greer, Pulitzer-winner: ‘I have to watch I don’t get arrogant’Read more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Novels about novelists are always a risk, but Less is about anyone who has allowed their calling to define them at the expense of their humanity.
