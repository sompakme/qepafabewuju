 The iconic Cabo San Lucas Arch was the first landfall site of hurricane ‘Odile’ in 2014, with rough waters and winds exceeding 140 kilometres per hour causing a drastic change in the local ecosystem, with tonnes of sand being removed, resulting in structural collapses and the eradication of flora and fauna.
 What happened to the arch in Cabo San Lucas in this regard? According to Javier Gaytán Moran, head of the geology department at the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur, “the famed arch of Cabo San Lucas could collapse at any time owing to natural causes, due to a fracture in the structure of the rock produced by nature” (UABCS)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
