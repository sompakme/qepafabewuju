It seems that she is still open to Cupid’s arrow, but she has certain criteria.</p><p>The WWE personality logged onto X, and she made things very clear. Anyone who wants to ask her out must mind her schedule. She’s not about to get caught out late at night, so 6:00 PM seems to be her cut-off time.</p><p>Got asked out on a date, and they asked if dinner at 8:30 pm was cool. I am sorry, but I will not be available at that time. If we’re not meeting by 6 pm, you will not be able to get me out of my house.</p><p><a href=#>Kayla Braxton has been open in the past about casual dating</a>. She doesn’t share a lot about her personal life on social media, but it is apparent that she id still trying to find that right person, if they can follow her rules.</p><p>We’re hoping that Kayla Braxton is able to find love, whenever they can arrange the date. It might be a good idea that anyone who wants to get some time with Miss Braxton needs to block off an earlier slot on their schedule.</p><p>Kayla Braxton will keep up her WWE life, as crazy as that might be.
