Therefore, it's no surprise Anderson picked up on Gubler's talents and invited him to audition for his 2004 film "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" featuring Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Owen Wilson</a>, per <a href=#>Cheatsheet</a>.&nbsp;Despite being a small role, Gubler's appearance led to his casting in "Criminal Minds" the following year. And it's clear Gubler was passionate about the series, having starred in every episode up until its finale in 2020 ... or perhaps it was because he was absolutely rolling in dough?</p><p dir=ltr>Gubler, who also directed and wrote a few episodes of "Criminal Minds," reportedly earned $100,000 per episode between 2012-2016, before getting a raise to $150,000, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;But his earnings didn't stop there, as due to syndication, Gubler's salary was approximately $3.5 million per year.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Moving away from FBI agents, Gubler has also dabbled in other roles like playing the dorky friend of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character in "500 Days of Summer." He even lent his voice to "Alvin and the Chipmunks." Gubler also wrote and illustrated the New York Times best-selling children's book, <a href=#>"Rumple Buttercup: A Story of Bananas, Belonging, and Being Yourself,"</a> and directed music videos for The Killers. Despite "Criminal Minds" ending, we're sure Gubler is keeping busy with some other idiosyncratic project. But if not, he's got a nice nest egg with Celebrity Net Worth estimating him at $10 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxpZoVxe8eormalpZi1brXSZqSarKSdsrh5xquYsmWXqq%2BtsdFmqZ6ZnKHGbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
