Aerosol foggers or bombs are the most popular since they are so simple to use, but when it comes to dealing with brown recluse spiders, they don’t perform nearly as effectively as they should. Spiders that come into immediate contact with the spray are killed; after the spray has dried, the spiders are mostly unharmed by the spray.
