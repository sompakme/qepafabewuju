With so much versatility, it's easy to see they are a go-to, timeless style. "You can style box braids in so many ways and they are suitable for different occasions," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tamara Albertini</a>, Holistic Master Braider and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ancestral Strands</a>. "You can wear them to work, out on the town, or even in a beautiful updo for a wedding." Below, we asked a few master braiders to share some box braid styles that will get you tons of compliments this summer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ombr-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ombré Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ombré styles aren't exclusively for loose hair, they can look great on braids too. These bold hot pink ends are a fun way to add color. "This style is very edgy, making it prefect for the coming summer months," says Albertini. "My clients always tell me what style and hair color they want. This client just said, 'Hey, I would like ombré pink ends,' and my answer was, 'You got it! Let's do it!'"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-highlight-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Highlight Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've been thinking about adding color to your box braids, but you're not sure if you want to take the plunge, highlights are a great way to test out a few colored braids without making a full commitment. "It's always fun to add highlights," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pearl Ransome</a>, Master Braider and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Pearl The Stylist Studio</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-triangular-part-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Triangular Part Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Box braids are typically characterized by box partings on the scalp, hence the name. However, there's no rule that says you can't change the partings every once in a while. For this look, Albertini adds her own spin on the traditional style by incorporating triangular parts. "One thing I love about braids is the number of styles you can do, and how you can tweak popular styles," says the stylist. "For this look, my client said she wanted triangular parts. Sometimes it's not only my brain working to add spice to the braid styles. My clients contribute to the creative process as well."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-colored-elastic-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Colored Elastic Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The color you add to your braids doesn't always have to come from hair extensions. Hair accessories are another way to jazz up box braids for the summer. For this look, Ransome used colored elastic bands to add peeps of color throughout the hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Tracee Ellis Ross's Chunky Butt-Length Braids Are the Perfect Summer Style</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beaded-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beaded Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Give your braids an old school '80s vibe by stacking beads at the ends. Whether you choose to go with wooden beads, multicolored beads, or simple clear plastic, this look is a must for any summer festival — just imagine how your hair will jingle as you throw your hands up in the air to the beat of the music.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fluorescent-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fluorescent Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a summer style that will make you stand out in a crowd, look no further. "Fluorescent box braids are trending right now and are perfect for clients who want something different," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marlisha Lofton</a>, Master Braider and Hair Extension Specialist. For this style, Lofton used the knotless braiding technique which gives the braids more flexibility and creates less tension on the scalp.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fluorescent-braids-and-blonde-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fluorescent Braids and Blonde Highlights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Colorful braids with extensions are perfect if you're looking to test hair colors on your skin tone without the major commitment of permanently dying your natural hair," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Erinn Courtney</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StyleSeat</a> hairstylist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Make a statement with these fluorescent pink braids with blonde highlights.

The great thing about box braids is that you can tryout bright colors and be adventurous with styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This slanted box braid bob is a fun style if you want to experiment with the shape, length and color of your braids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-goddess-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Goddess Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a chic, boho look? This protective style is the way to go! "The curly ends add a little flavor to the simple individual braids," says Courtney.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-box-braid-bun></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Box Braid Bun</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Putting your box braids up in a bun is an easy way to create a glamorous look for a special occasion. Wrap the braids around the bun for a soft, elegant look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-boho-box-braid-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Boho Box Braid Bob</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Why have straight or curly braids, when you can have both? This box braid curly bob is a great playful style for summer and the length makes it easy to maintain. "Curls allow me to be more creative while styling and they add volume to this look," says Ransome.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jumbo-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jumbo Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although medium-sized box braids look fabulous, it's completely understandable if you don't want to sit still for five hours braiding your hair. Jumbo box braids often take less than half the time to install and you still get a sleek summer look with just as much versatility.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bohemian-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bohemian Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These bohemian box braids showcase a mix of curly and straight braids and provide an effortless-chic vibe. "The long braids with flowing body waves are great for hanging out at the beach or lounging by the pool," says Lofton. "This is a great protective style. You can nourish your hair and scalp with all the essential oils it needs without weighing down the hair, because you can't see the oil on the braid extensions like you can with natural hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-waist-length-jumbo-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Waist Length Jumbo Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zendaya's extra long, jumbo box braids are the perfect look when you want to really go for a *look*, but since the braids are thick, you don't have to worry about your edges being compromised. It's the best of both worlds!<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-half-up-half-down-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Half-Up, Half Down Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gabrielle Union's stunning half-down, half-up braided style is perfect for a girls night out or a romantic date night.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-heart-parted-jumbo-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Heart Parted Jumbo Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you really want to stand out from the crowd, go for jumbo box braids with an adorable heart part. To make sure that the hair stays frizz free, use an edge control like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pattern Edge Control</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jumbo-blond-braid-extensions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jumbo Blond Braid Extensions</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Want to change up your look but also don't want to sit in the stylists chair for hours on end? Get inspiration from Amandla Stenberg's jumbo blonde box braids. As a matter a fact, this look is so simple you could do it yourself — get a rattail comb, a pack of blonde Kanekalon braiding hair, edge control, and a mirror to see the back.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cornrows-and-box-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cornrows and Box Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You don't have to choose between cornrows and box braids — Storm Reid shows us how we can do both. For a bit of visual contrast, cornrow your hair in a fun pattern on the crown and let the rest go free.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-braided-high-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Braided High Ponytail</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Update your basic braided high ponytail like Janet Jackson and opt to braid your box braids into larger sections. This helps to create more volume and add a bit of visual contrast. Just make sure you don't keep this style in for too long — the constant pulling and the heaviness of the braids can potentially lead to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>traction alopecia</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-braided-space-buns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_108-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Braided Space Buns</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_111-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a way to keep your long braids out of your face but don't want to deal with the (literal) headache of wearing your braids in a big top bun, opt for adorable space buns like Peloton's Hannah Frankson. Don't forget to lay down the baby hairs to complete the look!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-91d22e22-d3ba-4fe1-8a56-de5744a0d9fd></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How much do box braids cost?</span></p><p>The cost of box braids will depend on a number of factors — how thick/thin, how long you want them, the type of hair you'll use, plus your location and stylist.
