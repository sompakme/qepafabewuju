She opened her statement with a quote from the bible and then proceeded to tell the court that there were no murders that occurred in the deaths of Tylee Ryan, JJ Vallow, and Tammy Daybell.</p><p>"Jesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case," she said (via <a href=#>Fox 13 Now</a>). "Jesus Christ knows what happened here. No one was murdered. Accidental deaths happen. Suicides happen." She further claimed she had died while giving birth to Tylee, adding, "I was told by Jesus that I needed to go back and complete things that I had covenanted or promised to do before I was born."&nbsp;Following her victim's deaths, Vallow Daybell said that they contacted her, with Tylee and JJ assuring her that she was blameless."You didn't do anything wrong, Mom. I love you, and I know you loved me every minute of my life," JJ supposedly told her. Her "wonderful friend" Tammy also appeared to "bring peace and comfort," she claimed, adding that all three victims are "happy and busy in the spirit world." She said she looks forward to the day they will reunite. "I too will rest with them in the arms of my Jesus," she concluded.</p><p>Meanwhile, her husband, Chad Daybell, faces similar charges. However, he faces the death penalty. His trial date is set for April 1, 2024, per <a href=#>CBS News.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlaIZ0fY6lpquhXauurbjOsGSdmamXsq24jK2wpZ2VYreredKepa2dnpi2r7OMnJ%2BipJyeu6h7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
