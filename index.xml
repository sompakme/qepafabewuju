Susie Salmon from Alice Sebold’s novel The Lovely Bones. Although no one would ever desire for Susie Salmon’s character to be based on a real-life occurrence, the novel is based on the murder of a little girl in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the 1970s, which inspired the novel.
It is true that the rapist in The Lovely Bones is a combination of numerous real-life serial rapists and murders, but the author, Alice Sebold, was once raped in a tunnel where she discovered that another victim had been sexually assaulted and dismembered, therefore the novel is inspired by genuine events.</description></item><item><title> The 1975 Fallingforyou lyrics</title><link>/the-1975-fallingforyou-lyrics.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-1975-fallingforyou-lyrics.html</guid><description>What time you coming down?

Mice will immediately seek out a safe haven in your house, preferably one that is adjacent to a food supply, such as your kitchen or dining room, after they have gained entry. As a result, mouse nests are often discovered under kitchen equipment and at the back of refrigerators. There’s also a lot of heat in that location.

顧名思義，整部電影就是在講述一位讓男主角難忘的女孩，Annie Hall。Annie Hall不同於一般紐約女孩那樣精明伶俐，反而帶著點天真的傻氣。她把吃一半的三明治丟車裡，她的口頭禪是La Di Da，她不穿甜美性感的迷你裙或緊身洋裝，寬鬆的褲子、西裝背心裡繫上領帶，最好再加一副復古墨鏡，才是Annie Hall的Style。Annie Hall引領起了中性穿搭的風潮，儘管已過了40年，她的風格依舊不敗，成為影史中的經典時尚Icon。
・《曼哈頓Manhattan》的Mary Wilkie
當原本飾演Annie Hall的黛安·基頓（Diane Keaton）走進《曼哈頓》，她就搖身成為了聰明獨立的新女性，甚至也帶著伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）式的神經質；她與男主角句句針鋒相對，卻又在齟齬中併發愛戀。依舊是帶著中性氣質的打扮，但Mary Wilkie的品味更偏向懷舊的學院風，隨性中展現細膩，2012年時設計師Scott Sternberg甚至依照Mary Wilkie的風格為美國品牌Band of Outsiders設計出了早秋系列（ㄧ 度停擺的Band of Outsiders 也將在2017紐約春夏時裝週回歸！）。
・《甜蜜與卑微Sweet and Lowdown》的Hattie與Blanche
西恩·潘 (Sean Penn)輕輕撥弄吉他琴弦，關於愛情的甜蜜與卑微隨著旋律緩緩散開。他飾演的Emmet Ray，號稱世界第二的吉他手，他盤旋於眾多女性之間，薩曼莎·莫頓（Samantha Morton）飾演的啞巴洗衣工Hattie卻是一直默默的仰慕著這位驕傲自負的吉他手，總是穿著暖色系的Hattie，喜歡紅色針織帽、鵝黃色洋裝，或是一頂彩色條紋圓帽搭配圓點連身裙，她女孩子氣的可愛打扮充滿天真無邪的溫暖氣質。而鄔瑪·舒曼（Uma Thurman）飾演的名媛Blanche則是與Hattie有著極大反差，她成熟世故，她精明也冷血，她身穿皮草或貼身禮服，一頭金色捲髮則透露她的高貴奢華，兩個女主角的個性都在服裝穿搭上有跡可循。

・《午夜巴黎Midnight in Paris》的Adriana
在巴黎的午夜搭上馬車，過了12點，你就能找到屬於你的美好年代。電影編劇Gil搭上了那輛馬車，他遇見海明威與費茲傑羅，也和達利及曼˙雷碰上了一面，他給葛楚˙史坦審閱他的小說，然後他愛上了畢卡索的情人－Adriana。有別於Gil在21世紀的未婚妻，1920年代的Adriana浪漫而勇敢，聰慧而充滿藝術氣息，冒險精神與神秘氣息共存在她的雙眼裡；她穿白色絲綢洋裝時能夠展現復古典雅，而當她金色禮服上的流蘇閃動、纖細的手指夾著優雅長煙，又透露出20年代女性獨有的傲慢與高貴，這是伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）假想畢卡索擁有的繆思形象，也是他本人深深著迷的女性特質。

・《藍色茉莉Blue Jasmine》的Jasmine
當紐約貴婦破了產，名牌包是她流浪時的唯一家當。原本生活在上流社會享盡奢華的曼哈頓名媛Jasmine，當她失去了所有財產、失去了丈夫，她淪落為瀕臨精神崩潰的流浪貴婦，只有Hermès柏金包與Chanel外套相依偎。造型師Suzy Benzinger成功打造了紐約上東區的富豪女性打扮，Jasmine從頭到腳一絲不苟的單品挑選，展現了她即使身敗名裂仍然要奮力維持的品味。在這樣光鮮亮麗的體面裝扮下，是一個破碎的人生，伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）以Jasmine的高級時尚與她挫敗失序的命運做出極大的諷刺與反差。
