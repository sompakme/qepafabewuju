Overall, he has made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to his investments. Furthermore, he is always looking to expand his empire. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Whether it be through television shows</a> or alcohol brands, Fif knows exactly what he is doing. These days, 50 has been jonesing to get in on some NBA ownership. There are plenty of teams out there looking to add to their ownership groups, and Fif is definitely someone who could bring a lot to the table.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In fact, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> is already partnered with at least one NBA team. Although this is not in an ownership role, the artist is certainly embedded within the league. This is all thanks to a strategic partnership with the Indiana Pacers. Fif's Sire Spirits brand is currently being sold at Pacers games. As a result, 50 Cent can oftentimes be seen at Pacers games. In fact, earlier this week, he went to a game in Indianapolis <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">that was also being attended by Will Ferrell.</a></p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-speaks>50 Cent Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Thursday night, however, 50 was back in the building. As it turns out, he got to see an incredible game against the Houston Rockets, which eventually went to overtime. Overall, the Pacers were able to take over in the final minutes of the match. This led to a huge victory that certainly gave the team some morale. Subsequently, Fif went into the Pacers locker room where he spoke to the players and offered some amazing words of encouragement. Everyone seemed happy to have him there, and it is certainly not the first time he has been welcomed into their space.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If the Pacers are ever for sale and they need a buyer, 50 Cent could prove to be a trusted name in that process. For now, however, the artist is simply happy to have his products sold at the games. It is a partnership that benefits everyone. Moreover, the players get to see a legend at their games on a regular basis.
