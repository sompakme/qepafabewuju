Our analysis</h3><p>The Gala Spins sign-up offer does not offer the highest bonus amount, but from a £10 deposit the £20 reward is certainly worth taking up.</p><p>On top of this, you get 30 free spins each worth 10p – essentially an extra £3 in bonuses.</p><p>These spins have no wagering requirements so are a great extra incentive to sign up to Gala Spins.</p><p>The bonus funds have a 40x wagering requirement and a seven-day expiry so it is not the most straightforward offer to complete.</p><p>On balance, the healthy deposit-to-bonus ratio means that the Gala Spins sign-up offer is very respectable but you must be aware of the wagering requirements before taking advantage of it.</p><h3>Online casino bonus code similar to the Gala Spins sign-up offer</h3><p>If you already have taken up the Gala Spins sign-up offer, check out the similar BetVictor casino sign-up offer.&nbsp;</p><p>For the same deposit amount of £10, you will get £30 in bonuses as well as 100 free spins.
