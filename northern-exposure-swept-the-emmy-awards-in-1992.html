(It rose as high as 11th place in its fourth season.) The show swept the 1992 Emmys, winning for writing, supporting actress (Valerie Mahaffey) and outstanding drama.</p><p>“The only thing that was weird was that [the creators] were adamant that [the cast] didn’t get up [onstage] with them,” Morrow recalls. “And that hurt our feelings, because we didn’t understand why.”</p><p>This story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
