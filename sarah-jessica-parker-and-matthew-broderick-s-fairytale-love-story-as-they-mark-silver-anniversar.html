Last month, Broderick said&nbsp;he knew right away&nbsp;that he would marry Sarah.</p><p>“Oh, the first time I met her,” Broderick told&nbsp;<a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>&nbsp;while on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live. “I saw her walking down the street and thought ‘That’s it.'” He later added that he admires Sarah’s humour and wisdom qualities the most.</p><p>They laid eyes on each other for the first time in 1991, six years before their wedding. Thankfully, it was the Cupid work of Sarah’s brothers Pippin and Toby who came up with the idea to get them together, as they loved Broadway.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy anniversary, Matthew Broderick & Sarah Jessica Parker!</p>— oh Malarkey!
