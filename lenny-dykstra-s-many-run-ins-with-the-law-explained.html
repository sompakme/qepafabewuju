In 1999, the former MLB star faced "misdemeanor charges of sexual battery and child annoyance," per <a href=#>CBS</a>. The 17 year old, who worked at his car wash, alleged that Dykstra had touched her inappropriately over her clothes. The court ended up clearing Dykstra of all charges because there was insufficient evidence to prove&nbsp;beyond a reasonable doubt he did what the teenager claimed.</p><p>This wasn't the last time Dykstra was accused of making unwanted sexual advances. In 2011, one of his housekeepers alleged the former MLB player had sexually assaulted her, per <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. The housekeeper claimed that Dykstra "forced her to give him oral sex on Saturdays." Dykstra denied all the accusations and claimed the woman was only using him to get money and buy drugs. In the end, prosecutors didn't file charges due to the lack of evidence that the oral sex was forced.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Reuters</a>, Dykstra saw another run-in with the law in 2011 after he was charged with indecent exposure on accusations he exposed himself to six women. Frank Mateljan, Los Angeles City Attorney's spokesman, shared that the Mets player posted on Craigslist listing a job as his housekeeper. However, that wasn't his true intention. Mateljan said, "He [Dykstra] would inform them that they also needed to give him a massage, and then he would take off his clothes and expose himself to them."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
