Throughout the interview, the pair discussed women’s empowerment while chatting about Katharine – who was responsible for breaking the Watergate scandal. Notoriously stern Anna admitted that she was terrified of Katharine, telling Meryl: "She was so tall, and spoke so well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d834e2c5f555-anna-wintour-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eHwZPLHjadHo data-wc=15><strong>Anna was all ears as Meryl spoke about her new film role in The Post</strong></p><p id=ebU1Byf0AiY_ data-wc=53>&nbsp;Back in September, meanwhile,&nbsp;a newly-emerged deleted scene from divided fans’ opinions on the entire movie, by showing Miranda in a very different light.
