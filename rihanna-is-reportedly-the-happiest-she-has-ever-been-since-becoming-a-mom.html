The magnitude of how much it weighs.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When you make decisions of what you're going to say yes to, it has to be worth it,” Rihanna said, later adding, “The Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world. As scary as that was because I haven’t been on stage in seven years, there’s something exhilarating about the challenge of it all. It’s important for me to do this this year. It’s important for representation. It’s important for my son to see this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570aKfmqaelnqjscinnmaln6J6qa3PqbBmb2FmfXKBlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
