Y2K fashion is currently dominating, the fashion world's love affair with Nineties minimalism is continuing and now Boho has also returned like it never left. It’s the year of borrowing styles of yesteryear previously banished to the dark corners of fashion’s past and we have to admit, it's working.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With a history that spans over 200 years, the exact origin of the Boho aesthetic is hard to pinpoint. Some believe Bohemian culture was founded as a counterculture in the late 18th century following the French Revolution. It was a time that saw the end of patronage, when the elite privately supported the arts, and many creatives were plunged into poverty.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Others believe the French word 'Bohémien' was a disparaging term first used to describe Romani people, who back then were believed to have come to France from Bohemia, an ancient medieval kingdom that now forms the largest historical region of the Czech Republic.</p><img alt="the gypsy and her children la bohémienne et ses enfants" title="The Gypsy And Her Children (La Bohémienne Et Ses Enfants)" width=879 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-gypsy-and-her-children-1853-1854-private-collection-news-photo-1658338567.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Heritage Images</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>La Bohémienne Et Ses Enfants, 1853-1854</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Either way, it was a term with one meaning: to describe a section of society that lived an unconventional and often nomadic lifestyle, which was reflected in their aesthetics. Care-free, fluid fabrics dominated often with patterns and cuts inspired by historical dress and European artisans from all over the continent.</p><img alt="fashion by poiret" title="Fashion by Poiret" width=2520 height=3953 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-gimbels-wearing-a-dress-by-paul-poiret-march-1914-news-photo-1658314290.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Apic</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Model wears design by Paul Poiret, 1914</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the early 20th century, 'Bohémien' crossed over from a pejorative term to one that even the wealthy chose to embrace. In the first two decades of the 20th century, French fashion designer, Paul Poiret, pioneered the use of draped fabrics and allowed women to move away from tight corsets towards unstructured garments. He created signature Boho items like the hobble skirt, harem pants, and the 'lampshade' tunic, which became widely popular. The elite began to embrace a kind of 'haute Bohémien', wanting to be associated with a movement synonymous with the individual and creative thinkers.</p><img alt="couple dancing" title="Couple Dancing" width=1024 height=691 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/couple-dancing-in-a-public-park-1969-news-photo-1658314157.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Owen Franken - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Woodstock, 1969</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An aesthetic that has constantly evolved, the 21st century ushered in a new kind of Boho dressing during the 1960s and 1970s. Merging with the hippie movement that stood for similar ideas of championing self-expression and rejecting conventional ideals, Woodstock in 1969 was a watershed moment that undoubtedly played a seminal role in redefining the aesthetic. Floral, airy dresses were present but so too were flared silhouettes, embroidery, ponchos, moccasins, balloon sleeves and fringing.</p><img alt="mandatory credit photo by tim rookeshutterstock 458459dsienna millersienna miller at the glastonbury festival, somerset, britain 25 jun 2004" title="SIENNA MILLER AT THE GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL, SOMERSET, BRITAIN - 25 JUN 2004" width=2111 height=3166 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sienna-miller-ugg-boots-1611828859.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tim Rooke/Shutterstock</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Shutterstock</span><p>Sienna Miller at Glastonbury, 2004</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the mid-Noughties when Sienna Miller and Kate Moss stepped out in era-defining outfits thick with Bohemian influence, an official 'festival' look was born. Arctic Monkeys and Razor Light were the soundtrack and rah-rah skirts, layered necklaces, studded belts and knee-high suede boots were the outfit of choice.</p><img alt="boho nicole richie" title="Grand Opening of Diane Merrick Boutique Los Angeles - June 21, 2006" width=1874 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nicole-richie-during-grand-opening-of-diane-merrick-news-photo-1658479271.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michael Tran Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Nicole Richie, 2006</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">'Boho chic', credited in part to then stylist-to-the-stars, Rachel Zoe, was the hottest style going and from 2004 to 2007, there wasn't an It-girl in town that didn't dress with a Bohemian flare. From Nicole Richie to Mischa Barton and the Olsen twins, their style was defined by layers, billowing fabrics, cropped jackets and a Chloé Paddington or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a40443203/balenciaga-city-bag/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Balenciaga City Bag" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Balenciaga City Bag</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast forward to 2022, and Boho has returned to the runway with a vengeance.

At Altuzarra, Gigi Hadid appeared in head-to-toe tie-dye and at Etro, waistcoats were back and patterns were bigger than ever.</p><img alt="boho 22" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gigi-hadid-boho-ss22-1658323310.jpeg title="Boho 22" width=1600 height=2400 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Given the last few years of lockdowns, it’s not surprising an aesthetic that is free-spirited and shuns structure is reigning supreme.
