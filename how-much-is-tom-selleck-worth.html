That fortune is estimated to be $45 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and the website reports the "Three Men and a Baby" actor earns nearly $200,000 for each episode of "<a href=#>Blue Bloods</a>."</p><p>This means Selleck, who has been <a href=#>starring as Frank Reagan on the popular CBS drama series</a> since 2011, makes "around $5 million per season," as Celebrity Net Worth states. It seems his net worth will likely rise as he's set to star in the upcoming "Untitled Jesse Stone Project" TV movie, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>.</p><p>As the lead of countless Hollywood hits, it's no surprise Selleck is a multi-millionaire. Aside from landing gigs in "Quigley Down Under," "<a href=#>Friends</a>," "Killers," and "Meet the Robinsons," he took home $500,000 per episode when he starred on "Magnum, P.I." Despite making the big bucks, Selleck stepped away from the action show and "quit" in order to make more time for his family.</p><p>"I knew intellectually what it would mean in terms of being a public person, but until you've lived it, there's no way to understand it," he said to <a href=#>People</a> in April 2020. "I had a feeling of, 'I don't think I'm cut out for this.'" Fortunately, Selleck has learned to balance his private and public lives while staying successful.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlkZoZ3e8eormalpZi1brXSZquopV2osq24xJyiZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
