Ranking among the greatest TV shows of all time, Breaking Bad won 16 Emmy Awards and six Critics Choice Television Awards. It was named the most critically acclaimed show ever by Guinness World Records in 2013—the same year its devastating series finale aired. The ground-breaking AMC production chronicled Walter White's descent from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to a murderous drug kingpin after he devised a plan to cook methamphetamine following a cancer diagnosis.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The show shattered TV tropes by presenting a protagonist who significantly evolved, catching viewers off-guard as Bryan Cranston, previously known for comedic roles like the Seinfeld dentist and Malcolm in the Middle dad, delivered an Emmy-winning dramatic performance as the doomed Walter White. The show's success spawned the 2019 movie El Camino and the spin-off series Better Call Saul (2015-2022), reuniting fans with the beloved characters in a 2023 Super Bowl commercial. With the series' spectacular run presenting further opportunities, here’s what Cranston and the rest of the Breaking Bad stars have been up to, from maintaining friendships to winning Tony awards and running breweries.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bryan-cranston><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong></h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 21: Bryan Cranston attends the opening night of "Hangmen" on Broadway at Golden Theatre on April 21, 2022 in New York City.

He won a Tony Award for portraying President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Broadway play All the Way, which he later reprised for an HBO movie. Cranston landed major film roles, including an Oscar-nominated turn as Dalton Trumbo in Trumbo, as well as parts in Godzilla, Wakefield, and Wes Anderson's Asteroid City. He returned to his Breaking Bad role in the 2019 film El Camino and the final season of Better Call Saul. Cranston also won a second Tony for the Network Broadway adaptation in 2018. Beyond acting, he launched a mezcal brand, Dos Hombres, with Breaking Bad co-star Aaron Paul. Most recently, Cranston has been an outspoken advocate for entertainment workers during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-aaron-paul><strong>Aaron Paul</strong></h2></span><p>BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 11:Aaron Paul attends the Premiere Of Apple TV+'s "Truth Be Told" at AMPAS Samuel Goldwyn Theater on November 11, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California.
