The governor had withheld his assent rightly stating that such amendments would create confusion and breach constituted laws.“The Rivers House recently again overrode the decision of Fubara not to assent to some bills. They even resumed impeachment proceedings against the Governor."We are not surprised though because Wike has consistently made careless remarks undermining the President. He has been very heedless and uncult."Therefore, we are giving the FCT Minister 24 hours to apologise for disrespecting the President. Failure to do so would attract massive protests across the country calling for his sack".<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9a297933adf5c4a7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Perish the thought”: PDP warns Wike, APC as calls for Fubara’s removal heightens</span></p></a><h2>Read more about Rivers political crisis:</h2><h2>Shehu Sani speaks on Rivers crisis</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, former Kaduna Central senator, Shehu Sani, has said President Tinubu’s peace initiatives in Rivers state have crumbled, adding that Governor Fubara and the FCT minister have returned to the battlefield.</p><p class=align-left>Sani sarcastically said <a href=#>the National Assembly should intervene</a> after President Tinubu’s deal failed to produce the desired result.</p><p class=align-left>He added that if the federal lawmakers also fail to resolve the political crisis, then men of God led by Pastor Enoch Adeboye, Chris Oyakhilome, Apostle Johnson Suleiman, and Bishop Mathew Kukah should intervene.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvbC4yK2gnKtfZoJ6fZVxcGaqmauys7%2BMnKmiq5moerq70a6ZmmWppMK1tNJmnqunpaV6o7HRmqueq12stqyxjJqanK2jmsBussKtZKahnp7AtbHRZpuiq6KawLGxwq2gp59dqbavwcGuZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
