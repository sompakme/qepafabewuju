The singer's most recent relationship was with Paul Solomons, and lasted between 2018 and 2023, according to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/celebrity-news/kylie-minogue-boyfriend-78003/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Now to Love</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGijqaG2pnnMoqWon6WaerS1zaCjnmWcpMOmecuinZ5lYmV%2FdXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
